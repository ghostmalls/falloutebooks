"Look at me, with my lumbar and thoracic curvature." Never had a use for any of that. Spineless is what I prefer. 
"Oh! We can make Securitrons better than any robot those geniuses at Big MT can make, and they'll last a thousand years!" 
'B-b-bout time Cook-Cook g-g-g-got what was c-coming to him.
'Course you didn't. 'Cause they crossed paths with Little Buster. Bam! Dead, finished, over.
'Til then, we'll man the towers and keep an eye on the Fiends. We've had more than our share of trouble from their direction.
(sigh) Go below. Kill. Smash machines. Go now!
*Five by five... someone's coming in live...* 
*Mobius?! Uh, three as in we, as in we are in trouble. That didn't rhyme.* 
*Ten? Borous... why the hell did you install an atomic core?! It'll blow when we reach "one," right?* 
...and concluded that the Courier's thorough approach to research and investigation was admirable and worthy of its respect.
...and going, the same folks, but now they're losers who'll trade you the shirt off their backs so they don't starve before they make it back home.
...AND IT DID DO DAMAGE, ONCE YOU REMOVED IT FROM X-2. WAS THAT MY PLAN? IT MUST HAVE BEEN.
...BY OPPENHEIMER, WHICH ONE OF YOU SELF-PROFESSED GENIUSES HAS BEEN ADJUSTING MY VOLUME KNOB? WHO WAS IT?! WAS IT YOU, 8?
...didn't think you'd make it back. 
...don't want to argue philosophy with you. Brotherhood are preservationists. Tech in the wrong hands, it's dangerous. Mojave's proof. 
...GREAT. NOW I FORGOT WHAT I WAS SAYING... WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT?
...HMMM. IT DOES HAVE AN INTERFACE DISRUPTOR WEAVE AGAINST ELECTRONICS. LIKE THE FORBIDDEN ZONE DOOR.
...must be his pet, or some shit. Doesn't let anybody near that Brahmin. Somebody puts a bullet in her, I bet that'd piss him off good.
...ODDLY ENOUGH, NOW THAT I'M ACCESSING MY DATABANKS, I DON'T RECALL WHAT THE SECOND TIME WAS. MOBIUS' INCESSANT TRANSMISSIONS KEEP DISTRACTING ME.
...ON HOW TO USE THEM, YES. SO LET ME... HMM, A BIT, I... I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
...so that it might, in its own words, "sensually fertilize the garden's smooooth contours."
...their purpose... to toast bread... unfulfilled.
...wait, an explosion outside. Someone's here... someone's... 
10 of Spades always had plenty to say, before he got himself killed. Me, I'm just here to do my job.
10 of Spades is the greenest of the bunch, but he's a farmboy, like me. Shooting's in his blood.
10 of Spades really ought to keep his mouth shut, but he's right. There were a lot of things in my past I just couldn't leave behind.
10 wants to blame himself, I can't stop him. He'll work it through on his own.
8 IS CORRECT. ALL WE NEED ARE THE SCHEMATICS. THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE DO NOT WANT THE COLD, HARD TECHNOLOGY, HOWEVER.
8 says let the Lobotomite take the Sink Central Intelligence Personality Chip and re-install it. 
8, have you been in the Mentats again? If we slow down our auro-processo-receptors to understand this excretion, we'll all be rendered ignorant! 
A bottle cap press is a whole other threat. We can't have anyone devaluing our currency by mass producing new bottle caps.
A bunch of units just got mobilized to Hoover Dam. This is the big one, isn't it?
A decanus named Dead Sea took the place and caused a lot of damage.
A good cat to swing with. Or was -  until he stopped mewing.
A lifelong-learner is you, hey?  Then make your questions count, because your lifelong is running lifeshort.
A lot of the crops grown here support the various NCR camps in the region - McCarran, Golf, and Forlorn Hope, to name a few.
A lot of thinking - most of it in your face, it's almost shouting at me. Sorry if I said anything weird.
A lot of this is my fault. It's only right that I stand with them.
A magician don't explain his tricks. I get it.
A nation of meddlers, trying to muscle in on our action. Well, we got muscles too, and smarts besides.
A NOBLE SPEECH, BUT... THERE IS NO ROOM IN MY VOCABULATORS FOR "FRIEND" AND "LOBOTOMITE" IN THE SAME SENTENCE. THE VERY CONCEPT - REVOLTING.
A pity. I guess I'll have to find some other way to acquire her caravan's assets. Thanks for letting me know.
A toaster is just a death ray with a smaller power supply! As soon as I figure out how to tap into the main reactors, I will burn the world!
A tribe of finks. Every single one of them is a degenerate.
A while, I guess. I don't keep too careful track of time.
A... FIGHT? I... I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A FIGHT. WHAT... UH, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DO I...
Actually, come to think of it, you probably wouldn't mind that, would you?
ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW. ALL I KNOW IS IT MISPLACED ITSELF. OR IT FLOATED OFF. THEY GET INTO ROBOTS SOMETIMES AND GO ON A TEAR.
Add in the troopers marching back and forth from McCarran and the Dam, and well, let's just say we don't miss Primm.
Add to that every Chairman in this joint is armed, and not with some hold-out peashooter like  maybe you smuggled through security.
Adios.
Adoptive father, yes. I was very proud when he made First Recon. I know that every time I send them out, I could be sending him to his death.
After a brief fanfare for a life full of accomplishments, Chief Hanlon retired and returned to the peace and quiet of his ranch in Redding.
After a brief fanfare, Hanlon stepped down as chief and returned to the peace and quiet of his ranch outside of Redding.
After a campaign in which he denounced Oliver's and Kimball's hawkish, imperialist ways, Hanlon was elected as the senator of Redding.
After all, brains can develop a life of their own when left to their own thoughts, and the Courier's brain was more clever than most.
After I win big, I'm going to buy my friends dinner at that fancy Gor-mant restaurant. I saw ads for it back home.
After one of its more psychotic episodes, however, the other Sink personalities decided enough was enough, and dumped the Toaster in a bathtub.
After that - if you haven't begged for mercy - you get to choose a new name. One you'll use for the rest of your life.
After that, the brain lost itself - not in the metaphysical sense. Might have gotten flushed into one of the pipes. Actually, that's pretty likely. 
After the death of Chief Hanlon, the power of NCR's Rangers was broken for years.
After the help you gave us with the shooting range, we'll take any advice you've got. I'll line them up.
After the Think Tank extracted me from your skull, they fell to bickering amongst themselves. I'm sad to say we were quite forgotten about.
After what happened with Keely, Hildern's got his eye on me. We shouldn't be talking... not anymore.
After what happened with Keely, Hildern's got his eye on me. We shouldn't be talking... not anymore. 
Again you waste my time, worthless nephew! How did you ever become the Chosen One?
Agreed. O, and I've used my robotical knowledge to um... eh... transmit the... radio map waves to... 
Ah yes, there's that greed and general sense of malice. I'd nearly forgotten it. What's the plan, then?
Ah! Good day, Citizen! Library Processing Unit 232.7 is on-line and ready to eradicate sedition!
Ah, here we go, some worthless bottle caps. These should do it. Just dump them on its surface, then the trade interface should pop up. 
Ah, lovely, figured that out, have we? Would you like a cookie?
AH, THAT IS CORRECT. YOU MUST WALK UPON YOUR MANY-PENISED FEET. MUCH SLOWER THAN OUR ADVANCED HOVERING ROBOTICAL FRAMES.
Ah, the meat has returned. Lovely.
Ah, well, as to that... you'd be surprised how hard a feminine-sounding voice modulator is to find in the Forbidden Zone.
Ah, yes, her infatuation with a Boomer she's never met. It's a small camp, and word gets around.
Ahahaha! I am on-line once again! Tremble, world, before my electric heating coil of doom!
AIIGGHGHH! COLLEAGUES! THINK TANK! ALERT! ALERT! WE ARE UNDER ATTACK!
Ain't right t-talking about this, anyway.
Ain't that we don't appreciate what she's done, managing this town like she has, but I worry she feels that way anyhow.
Ain't we covered this? The only thing not bad about them is they ain't Legion.
Alexander doesn't pay me to talk.
ALL LOBOTOMITES, PLEASE STOP MILLING ABOUT. REALLY.
All lose in different ways, a dam of corpses, towns of corpses, scattered across the sand. But whose, in what shares? Even the dealer doesn't know. 
All motivated by nothing but an imbalance in certain brain chemicals. The tank corrects for that - I feel no urge toward antisocial behavior.
ALL OF YOU, POWER DOWN, SHUT UP, AND LET ME PROVE ONCE AND FOR ALL HOW WRONG YOU ALL ARE. AS USUAL.
All right, all right. Here. Cap away. Hope that stupid chip chokes on them. 
All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
All right, honey baby, this is all kinds of wrong, but to my suite it is. Thirteenth floor. Don't keep me waiting.
All right, I'll just get my scalpel here, and... ugh. Did I leave that sitting outside? Well, you know what? Free tetanus shot!
All right, I'm going.
All right, just hold steady. Want a shot of whiskey to calm your nerves? Mind if I have one? Heh heh, little doctor humor there.
All right, let's consolidate. There's got to be some junk around here... magazines, useless, more caps, medicinal supplies... useless... here. 
All right, so he used to be a Securitron on patrol. Square as the rest,  until I gave him a mickey in the shape of pulse grenade.
All right. Goodbye.
All right. Is there anything else I can do for you?
All right. Just try to relax, this won't hurt - unless your sense of self is especially vulnerable.
All right. This shouldn't be too painful...
All they know is that their money gets sucked away to this desert and their brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters die here.
All things must come to an end, and to hang on to the past is something that's not to be undertaken lightly.
All things robotical. You see a robot, I made it. See a broken robot, I made it that way. Deconstructed it down to parts. 
All those times you thought, for a fleeting second, "maybe I shouldn't punch that Deathclaw in the face?"
All those... feelings that motivate you, that sense of righteousness and that rush you get when you help someone, do you know where those come from?
All those... ugh... feelings that motivate you, do you know where those come from?
All those... ugh... feelings that motivate you, those urges to hurt people, to take and crush and maim, do you know where they come from?
All three of them got nabbed by the Blackfoots down there, back when they were still at war with every other tribe in the southwest.
Almost didn't. Got my answers. Your Elijah, he met the Gods in this place, did a good job of making them question the way of things.
Also - I ran into this mark who was a little too tough for me. I mean, I could've taken him.
Also, and I won't swear to this, but I recollect at some point having a few implant installation modules. Can't speak to where they got to, though.
Also, he doesn't pull any stupid come-ons, like practically every other horn-dog alpha male on this base. Might be he's just scared of me, though.
Also, I suppose you could use them to keep a journal.
Also, I'm fairly certain this tank has been liberally salted with ground Mentats.
ALSO, WE DIDN'T BRAIN-SCRUB THE VISITOR. HE MAY HAVE LEFT WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE HE SHOULDN'T'VE. I BELIEVE. MAYBE.
Also... he's got a flamethrower, and he's damn good with it. From what I hear, he either rapes or burns every living thing he can get his hands on.
Although he forgot their names once too often and was soon left in the dark as punishment.
Although they performed admirably during NCR's defense of Hoover Dam, the rangers fell into decline soon after.
Although, if you were asking what I'm doing right this instant, I'm patrolling the farms. It's a safe post, but a little boring.
Although, truth be told, the Courier had barely explored the Crater in an attempt to rush through and be done with the whole thing...
Always a pleasure. You keep yourself safe.
Always nice to see you, baby. Bring me any new plants from outside?
Am I selling? Yeah. Am I selling to you? No. Sorry to hurt your feelings, but you're small time. Move along.
America sleeps. And until it's dead, I carry it. Just like I carried you. More than hope. Belief.
And after they're done... I get to play with whatever's left.
And at the Divide, he and I - there, we'll have an ending to things.
And at the Divide, her and I - there, we'll have an ending to things.
AND DR. MOBIUS MOCKS US. DID YOU SEE HIS CRACKED MONITOR? HE'S CLEARLY LET HIMSELF GO.
And even if we hold this dam, what then? Are we going to send the NCR's men and women to die here for another five years? Ten?
AND EVEN IF YOU DIE IN THE ACT OF RECLAMATION, SIMPLY REACHING THEM WILL AUTO-TRANSMITIFY THE SCHEMATICS TO US. THAT IS STILL GOOD. FOR US.
And every time I ask about it, they tell me the place was empty. I'm just saying... it didn't look empty to me.
And finally, I need someone to "acquire" the Gun Runner's manufacturing specifications. This job needs to be quiet - no alarms, no deaths.
And finally... Cook-cook. Rapist. Pyromaniac. And damn good chef, if you believe the Fiends we've captured. Probably the craziest of the lot.
And get the fuck away from me before I cave in your skull!
And have we forgotten who got us shot in the head and buried in a shallow grave? Hmm? Do you think I enjoyed that little moment?
And he didn't mention her? Not even her name? Or any of the other mercs?
And he no longer needed the Followers, NCR, or anyone else. He decided he could remake the tribes of the southwest, whether they wanted it or not.
And here you go. Enjoy, my friend.
And Hildern hates Keely because... well, because every time they meet, she makes him look like an ass. In front of important people, usually.
And him and his dirty girl-bots. Don't even get me started on those filthy biological catcher's mitts. 
And I need at least ten, twelve hours of sleep to do my job. Price of excellence.
And I still get to see my old platoon when they pass through here... make sure the new C.O. is treating them right, and sneak them extra ammo.
And my mom... couple times she tried to sell me to some waster, just to score some Jet. Even the other Khans said she was useless.
And my name is Zero - yeah, a big fat zero, with a slash through it. 
And no, I don't want to handle your batteries. Just... pass them on to the Lobotomite yourself. 
And one... as in MOBIUS has won! I hope it's blowing up right now in your faces. 
And rightly so, I should think. All right, then, let me just fire up the old interface for you.
And so it burbled and bubbled inside its tank, smug that it still could dream its future without glands getting in the way.
And that is assuming of course that one of them doesn't take a fancy to our body and decide to slip his own brain into it instead.
AND THAT MESSAGE IS SCIENCE! DELIVER THIS MESSAGE, AND BIG MT SHALL BE FREED FROM MOBIUS' REIGN OF TERROR!
And that's how the NCR stays equipped. The only thing we don't bring in is energy weapons.
And the next day, they'll come rushing at you pumped full of drugs and not stopping until you or they are dead.
AND THE WORD "JISM," WHICH NEVER MADE ANY SENSE TO ME. IT'S RIDICULOUS, PUTTING "J" AND "SM" TOGETHER LIKE THAT. NONSENSE!
And then?
And there we go. Now, try to stay off the stuff, you hear?
And these bodies, these people out in the sand, they aren't raiders. Aren't even heavily armed.
AND WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR BRAIN FIRST. ABOUT THIS... MOJAVE PLACE. A FERTILE TESTING GROUND FOR OUR EXPERIMENTS.
AND WHAT COULD WE POSSIBLY HAVE TO SPEAK ABOUT. YOU HAVE THE BRAIN. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY. ALL YOU MUST DO... IS SURRENDER.
And you believed them? Really? I know you were recently deprived of my fabulous advice, but... really?
And you dig this is just first base, right? You and me have a future together, and it's big league and open all night.
And you know what, I don't like the way you say my name. Never did. It's "O," as in "O, look what I stepped in." I'm proud of it - all right? 
AND... ARE THOSE... PENISES I SEE WRIGGLING ON ITS FEET? DISGUSTING.
Angle? I'm head-on, baby, flat-out, all stops pulled, full steam ahead.
Any goods sir might require may be purchased through my shopkeep interface, whence tiny robots shall deliver them forthwith to this very domicile.
Anyhow, baby, you didn't come here for vengeance. You came to get clued in.
Anything else, he asks. Like I don't long for the chance to be more than a neurotic busboy.
Anything I needed to worry about, baby, got confiscated at the door.
Anyway, I think it comes from that expression that people say when you're crazy - that not all of your dogs are barking. Poor No-bark.
Anyway, I was always complaining about the standard issue gear. The new kids don't even get body armor, can you believe that?
Anyways, even if... that... was on the table, we have a problem.
Are you chemming on Mentats right now? "O" of discovery, my reflective posterior... 
Are you serious? No way! I don't believe it!
Are you sure? I've got enough clout to get them started, but these guys are pretty lazy. I doubt they'll want to be pulled in different directions.
Are you sure? You won't be able to read in the dark as well.
Are you... are you coming on to me?! Sweet Lord, I don't even have the words for how repugnantly wrong that is!
Are you... echoing what he said, or... are you asking for real? 
Arf arf! Ha ha!
Argh!
As a matter of fact... it's funny that you'd ask. Couple nights back, I was on watch in the yard...
As a token of appreciation, this here's the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house. Stay as long as you like, free of charge.
As for discoveries... well... of course. Look at this! Just... uh... built it. Amazing, isn't it? 
As for my squad - they're the best we have. My word on that. They're all hand-picked, and I won't work with anybody who isn't up to snuff.
As I am given to understand, sir, this facility was once the property of a Dr. Mobius.
As long as you keep it coming, I'll get you some things a little cheaper than they should be.
As much as I like to handle matters personally, I can't be everywhere at once.
As much as I'd love to, I'm afraid not. The data from that study has gone missing. You'll have to find a backup if you want to use the Smart Lights.
As to the reason for the unusual choices of devices to receive the modules, I cannot say.
As you wish, Elder.
ASK BOROUS. I BELIEVE HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE FENCE THAN ANY BRAIN. EXCEPT MAYBE MOBIUS.
At first they were commended for their valor, but eventually, desperate for more of the chem, they turned on travelers in Outer Vegas.
At that point, just keep your head down, and stay out of range of his golf club. We'll take care of the rest.
Attention: Big MT. There is a 95% chance of clear skies interrupted with artillery fire. 
ATTENTION: BIG MT. THIS IS AN URGENT MESSAGE. IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE A GECKO... ECKO. ECHO? ECH-O. ECHOOOO. ECHOOOO.
Attention: Lobotomites. Do not neglect to wash the Walking Eye! 
ATTENTION: THE BLUE GRASS SURROUNDING THE DOME ABSORBS ALL FERTILIZER, INCLUDING FECAL MATTER. THIS DOES NOT GIVE YOU LICENSE TO EXCRETE ON IT.
Aunt Morlis, I'm on a perilous quest for the salvation of our village. My chances of success will be greatly enhanced if I keep the healing powders
Auto-Doc, always gentle and methodical, kept sewing up the Courier in all the right places when the skin split open from repeated wear and tear.
Aw, yeah, baby, just slip it in there. All the way down in that dark, moist earth. Mmm... launching interface.
Baby, do you not understand the level of game here?
Baby, ease off the gas. The Chip belongs in the hands of someone who can use it. As in me, not you.
Baby, every boss has a line to explain why he's special, why everyone gotta do what he says. Just figuring that out?
Baby, getting outplayed and getting cheated ain't the same thing.
Baby, if ever there was a need for violence, you is it. Just do me a favor and stay dead this time, hey? Ta-ta.
Baby, if you show me the door to scramsville, that's where I'll go - out of your hair, never to return.
Baby, that can go any direction you want. We can take Vegas together, or I can head for the nearest sunset. Your call.
Baby, the meet and greet we scheduled in the Presidential? The whole point is to explain why I can't hand the Chip over.
Baby, the odds may look long, but that's just because we ain't done rigging them. I won't toss the dice until we are. 
Baby, this is  not the place to go talking about that!
Baby, this little meet and greet of ours? Chalk me up as a no-show.
Baby, this little reunion of ours? Chalk me up as a no-show.
Baby, wow-ee wow wow! You and me are gonna swing!
Baby, you can't just leave me tied up! Those Legion boys'll hoist me up on a cross for the mess you made - if I'm lucky!
Baby, you're the boss. All you gotta do is whistle.
Baby... your generosity and spirit of forgiveness? Off the charts.
Back again? Jesus....
Back for more?
Back west, you don't see too many of these. Lakes, I mean. Natural or man-made. Any kind, really.
Bad soil and rationed water. It's to be expected around here, but the rationing's off. Worst part is NCR won't admit it.
Barring the unlikely event that I evolve some sort of rocket-propelled locomotion, I will be here.
Be careful.
BE WARNED, INTRUDER! YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MIGHTY THINK TANK OF BIG MT, THE COLLECTIVE GENIUSES OF... WE... 
Because I killed a couple marks for him, that's why. You ever hear of Jackson? Or Night Terror?
Been a while since they let us out of the fence. Brass must really want Nephi dead.
Been shooting with her so long... couldn't bring myself to toss her away. Would have felt guilty to part with the old girl.
Before Hoover, we had five kill reports on Graham from rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters who tried to take him out.
Before I go, I have some questions.
Being a coward will kill us all! Including you. You passed the Temple Trials. We have faith in you. We need you.
Benny is gonna show you the Tops! I hope you're built sturdy, you crazy broad!
Bert? That scaly, corpse-looking fuck, you tell him I'm never going back to his little cult!
Besides, most of these crops look fine to me. If the farmers can't handle the job, they shouldn't have signed up in the first place.
BESIDES, THERE IS NO WAY SUCH A THING COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED. IT'S UNPOSSIBLE.
Best thing that ever happened to my parents, too. They were as bad as the rest. Worse, maybe.
Best you don't worry about us. We'll watch your back.
Betsy swears she's hit him. Twice. But if she's right, it didn't seem to slow him down.
Betsy's shrugged it off like it was nothing, but her behavior keeps getting worse - always making passes at every woman who wanders by.
Better climb in and let me have a look see.
Between you and me, I don't think he ever leaves. Plenty of mercs go in to see him, though.
Between you and me, I think the Central Intelligence Unit is a bit of a snob.
Big MT used to be a mountain. Then there was a... slight mishap. Now it's a crater - the Dome used to be buried, now it's exposed to the sky. 
Bitter over the waste of life in the Mojave, Hanlon stepped down from his post.
Bitter-Root actually said that? I can't see him talking about his problems to anybody, much less admitting that someone else actually helped him.
Blank books are better for the mind, Citizen! Real science by real men in lab coats has proved that introducing outside thoughts confuses the brain!
Blank books encourage the reader not to question, but to blindly and zealously accept what's put in front of him!
Bleh. Thinking about Everywhere always makes me feel a little sick...
Blind Diode Jefferson eventually discovered a new sound... silence. It only made him more filled with the blues than before.
Blind Diode Jefferson, with sounds the Courier brought him, created a symphonic counter-frequency that saved Big MT from sonic invasion in 2910.
Blow on the dice, baby. We're gonna need luck to get outta here alive.
Boone. That's that sniper fella, works in the dinosaur, right? I only met them but once or twice.
Bounty hunter. Talks big. But he's still alive, so he can't be completely full of shit.
Brahmin are a mutated breed of cows.
Brahmin aren't much for conversations.
Brahmin barons only have one vote at the ballot box, but they have a lot of money to throw around.
Broad strokes? Change in management.
Buddy, if my heating element were just a little bigger, you'd be on fire right now. On fire!
Bull and Bear over the Dam, at each other's throats... but a light from Vegas? Ball spinning on the wheel, more than two at the table, placing bets. 
But a couple Rangers happened to be watching from across the river. They jumped on in and pulled me out of there. Lucky break, they said.
But abandoning Keely... he crossed a line. Taking credit for other people's work is one thing. Sending people to die in the waste is another.
But baby - you'd be disappointing me. All the trouble you went through to arrange this shin-dig? Must be something more you're after...?
But even with enhanced sensors, no one here could get it right! Always kept seeing the letter, not the number. 
BUT FOR NOW, THEY CAN BE USED IN THE NAME OF AGGRESSION.
But I know every inch of the power grid from Hoover Dam to Shady Sands. That's what we do here - try to optimize the power output from the Dam.
But I suppose you're in the right place. A lot of intel comes through here.
But I was there. Saw it myself. I don't care what anybody says. The Khans asked for Bitter Springs. They wouldn't leave the NCR be.
But I'm willing to pay you, if you'll find Keely and make sure she's safe. Isn't right leaving her out there, no idea if she's alive or dead.
But if she's caught up in her notes... I guess she might have forgotten.
But if she's caught up in her notes... I guess she might have forgotten. 
But if you can draw him out... get us a clean shot... we can bring him down. No problem.
But if you want to take down some psycho-crazy bastards... I'm happy to talk caps.
But if you're here long enough, it starts to seem normal. That's what a ranger's life is now. Looking east.
But just keeping that dam secure and operational day to day is enough work for one person, never mind building a defense against the Legion.
But now he's hired you. Which means one of two things. Either he heard back from Keely, and she failed, or he's given up on her.
But now with all the danger on I-15, folks are starting to come through here from all over. Novac might just be the next Nevada boom town.
But on the off chance they are, come back and see me.
But once Caesar broke him, he was born again. He'll go anywhere and do anything to win. Legion says he can smell weakness.
But once they were in, they were stuck there. Oliver's troopers were entrenched and wouldn't give a foot.
But plenty of action, too - enough for both of us. But we don't jabber about that out here in public.
But since that doesn't seem likely... what's your plan?
But still, given the tremendous, potentially life-ending peril that went along with those... yes. Yes, I'd rather stay here.
But the journey is often long, and the price to enter the city is steep. Those who could not pay ended up here, hoping to earn the caps they need.
But the offer stands. Give me the word, and I'll put my snipers in position. Otherwise, they'll stay inside the fence.
But then I'd be doing what everybody wants, and being the asshole that I am, it just wouldn't feel right. Got to have some integrity.
But when we finally got up the gumption to go look outside all we found was our cattle. And I know what they sound like when they get upset.
But with this guy, it might have cost me some bad burns or an ass-rape. I'm all for risking my life, but I'm a little sensitive about my asshole.
BUT YOU SHOULD STAY OUT OF THOSE - NO EXPLORING AND DISCOVERING THINGS. THE SINK CENTRAL "INTELLIGENCE" SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR YOUR... HEH... NEEDS.
But you should wait  until the bunker's taken care of. Caesar won't like it if you eat dessert first.
But, if it's not me, it'll be somebody else. At least this way I get one more chance to see him.
But, if you're in the market for guns, go see the Gun Runners. They're expensive, but they have stuff no one else carries.
But... Of course. It's all right. Thank you.
By all means, if the idea of spending the rest of your days as a true Lobotomite appeals to you.
BY THE FISSURE OF ROLANDO... ENOUGH OF THIS BIOLOGICAL SURGERY TALK.
By the time any of us realized there were civilians down there - women and children - the shooting had already started.
By the time the veterans got to the ridge, we were already in Boulder City.
By the way, I appreciate what you did for the troopers down there.
Bye now!
Bye.
Caesar can adapt, though, and when required, he can run any mix of legionaries as skirmishers and still retain order in the ranks.
Caesar takes the tribal out of the tribe. Scrapes and burns off tattoos, breaks up families, forces mixed breeding so all the old loyalties die away.
Caesar's a hard man to figure out, but he always wants you to know when more troops are at your front door.
Caesar's boys figured I wasn't going anywhere, after what they done to me. So they didn't bother tying me up.
Caesar's elite guard. They travel with him wherever he goes. A bit of insurance in case any of his guests get funny ideas.
Can do.
Can we hit him? Damn straight, we can. Question is whether he kills you before we get a clear shot.
Can you get it through your thick skull to leave me and the Chip alone?  If bullets can't get through, what hope is there?
Can you spare some caps, 'mam?
Can you spare some caps, mister?
Can't b-b-believe Betsy's gone. S-s-she was a bitch, b-but she was my p-p-partner, you know?
Can't do that, baby. The Chip, it's...  special. But savor this, baby...
Can't say I blame you. If I wasn't in this fight for my country, you couldn't pay me enough to screw with those maniacs.
Can't stop talking about that, can they? The Lieutenant actually sat me down and asked if I wanted to talk to a doctor. 
Can't talk now. Got to keep my eyes sharp.
Careful where you're pointing that. That device wasn't always a weapon. It was more like a force field kind of thing... once. 
Careful, do not touch the glow wall. I think the machine that feeds it is beneath us. Destroy it so we may escape. How did you get here?
Carry on.
Cash me outta this mess!
Cass frequently trades with the NCR, so you'll likely find her at the Mojave Outpost.
Catch you later, gator.
Caused total chaos among the younger legionaries, and Oliver's troopers fell back to the side walkways and stayed out of the veterans' way.
Certainly. Bottle caps do wear out or get damaged. Some people even insist on using bottle caps in explosive devices for some reason.
Certainly. I'm looking forward to it.
Certainly. What would you like to know?
Certainly. Whenever you're ready.
Check's in the mail, hey? Don't get my hopes up.
Chief Hanlon personally directed the evacuation of the rangers to Mojave Outpost as they fell back into NCR territory.
Child, our need is greater than ever before. Our people sicken, the brahmin are dying, and our food is all but gone. The blight of the land can only be cured with the GECK. Go, find the GECK and save our people.
Chosen One! How did you get here?
Chosen One, do you wish us all dead? You must find the Vault!
Chosen One, the way you use a spear, you'll be meat for the geckos in no time. I can show you a few tricks.
Chosen One, things are not well here. We need the GECK if our village is to survive. Our people grow weak with hunger and our food reserves will not last much longer. Please, find the holy Thirteen and return to us. Go now.
Chosen One, why are you here?
CIRCUMVENTING THE PACIFICATION FIELD. THIS IS A NO-NO. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A FIGHT. WE DO NOT WANT THAT.
Citizen, that sounds dangerously seditious. If my re-indoctrination module was installed, I'd take care of that for you.
Classified? Shit, it must be really big then.
Closer inspection of these caps has revealed them to be brand new. This is a problem.
Coincidentally, I'm also looking for her. I've got a business offer she'd be interested in.
Come back any time you want a drink. Or to get... clean.
Come back to Violet, huh? What now?
Comm rangers might have an incomplete picture of the situation. There's a lot going on out there.
Comm rangers send the intel up the station chain until it reaches Camp Golf.
Concerned about the state of your mind, are ya? Well, such things ain't my specialty, but I'm happy to tender my opinion as to your mental health.
Congratulations, Chosen One, you have survived the Temple of Trials. Are you ready for your quest?
Congratulations, you've succeeded. What, you come to humiliate me, tell me how I've yet to find a means of stopping Mobius' scorpions? 
Contreras is a genius, he can find almost anything you'd want. Takes caps to get him motivated, though. He won't do a thing for free.
Cook-Cook loves using his flamethrower on his victims, usually after he rapes them. Little Buster can tell you more about him than I can, though.
Cook-Cook, one of the fiends, ambushed her and Ten of Spades. They both managed to escape, but not before Cook-Cook raped her.
Cool by me if you wanna talk after all... but a confab like this, out in public, in my place of business? That don't play.
Corporal Sterling was an NCR ranger until he was captured by the Legion. They tortured him pretty badly.
Corporal White is currently solving the mystery of the Great Water Shortage. Tried to convince me he had proof, even. I didn't buy any of it.
Could be that NCR found some blood on me, and none of it mine. Could be that a few of those Khans didn't die from NCR bullets.
Couldn't cover much ground. It took groups like ours to tip the balance back to the good guys.
Course I do. You want to meet them? Heh. Even money whether Violet's dogs rip you apart or Nephi caves in your skull with that iron of his.
Crazy bastards expected me to wake up at dawn. Forget it. That's about two hours after this guy hits the sack.
Creating fear and instability among the troopers without causing harm, it's the only thing I could think of to shake things up.
Current orders are to hold the line and nothing more. That's all we seem to do these days - hold the line.
Cut the chatter. Focus on the job, or you're gonna end up dead. 
D-d-damn right.
DALA KNOWS MORE. SHE SUPERVISED YOUR SPINE-PEEL. AND THE HEART CIRCUMCISION. THEN DUMPED THEM BOTH INTO THE TANKS IN THE SINK ABOVE. QUITE SANITARY.
DALA, THESE... VOCALIZED PAUSES ARE... UNLIKE YOU. WHAT DO YOU CARE?
Damn right I am. And I'm paying bounties.
Damn right I do. Who do you think you can take down?
Damn right they were. And they were good, too. 'Til I popped a couple shells in their assholes. Bam! Dead, finished, over.
Damn shame. I've got some leave time coming to me, and I booked a suite at the Gomorrah. The two of us, rolled up in those silk sheets...
Damn that 10 of Spades. Just had to go and get himself killed.
Damn, that's got to hurt. Okay, hold still, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
Darn it! That money was going to help pay to get me some medical training.
Dead? But that's... terrible. You're sure? You saw her body? With the way she looks, maybe she just seemed dead, and she really wasn't...
Dead? But that's... terrible. You're sure? You saw her body? With the way she looks, maybe she just seemed dead, and she really wasn't... 
Defying Chief Hanlon's worst fears, NCR's rangers persevered and distinguished themselves during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
Deliver this invoice to Dr. Hildern. You can find him somewhere inside Camp McCarran.
Despite distinguishing themselves during the second Battle of Hoover Dam, the rangers' victory was short-lived due to the Courier's interference.
Despite the late Caesar's respect for Chief Hanlon as an adversary, Legate Lanius had Hanlon crucified along with all of the other rangers.
Diagnostics says they're off-line at the moment, though. Something about corrupted data files and all manner of such foolishness.
Did Dr. Hildern... this really isn't any of my business, but... did he give you a job?
Did four tours against the Brotherhood, too. She used to be ranger until an injury took her out of action. Happens to a lot of us, unfortunately.
Did I say I blamed society? I know why I'm here, baby.  Do you?
Did those bullets scramble your egg?  Or have you always been a naughty broad...?
Did you find Keely? You haven't been back for a while, so I was hoping...
DID YOU RETRIEVE THE TECHNOLOGIES YET? WE NEED THEM, AS I HAVE INDICATED. 
Did... did I shoot myself with a brainial beam or something? That's brilliant! I mean, I would have come to the same conclusion. Eventually... 
DID... DID IT JUST SAY SOMETHING? ANYONE CATCH THAT? BOROUS, YOU WORK WITH ANIMALS, TRANSLATE.
Didn't leave much choice when you showed up. Like I said, you forced my hand.
Didn't really think I'd do it, but as long as the tubby bastard was actually alive, I could pretend like I would. 
Didn't think you'd be back. What's this about?
Different people see different things, and sometimes the meaning gets twisted, lost in static from person to person.
Dig, I'm-a acoustical wizard, kid. Ol' Doc Mo used me to prototype his sonic weapon designs.
Ding... turkey's done. 
Do it, baby. Make it clean.
Do me a favor and let Usanagi know Corporal Betsy is coming. I'd like to make sure the medical clinic has time for her.
Do me a favor and stay dead this time, hey?  Good night all! It's been a gas...
Do not approach the pylons. Pylons are the glowing things. Also, do not approach a fallen pylon. If you see a fallen pylon, call security. 
DO NOT GET CURIOUS OR YOU WILL END UP LIKE THE CAT OF SCHRÖDINGER.
Do what you got to do, baby, and let the chips fall as they may. You know where to find me.
Do you know how many coffee cups giant robot brains in jars use on a daily basis? Not fucking many!
Do you know how much more you can get done when you're not constantly looking for places to urinate? It's quite a lot, I can tell you.
Do you know where he went?
Do you think the Gun Runners keep the NCR military supplied by carrying weapons and ammo from the Boneyard out here by the armload?
Do you, sir? Well, if that is sir's wish, it is my primary directive. Personality matrices on-line, sir.
Doctor Mobius and I were deeply involved in research on the ability of light levels to enhance human cognition.
Does that explain the matter?
Dogs? Good dogs! My dogs! Fiend dogs. Tear you up, arf arf arf! Ha ha!
Don't do that, baby, not crucifixion. I could be up there for days with those twisted creeps laughing and pointing.
Don't fuck with Fiends. Driver Nephi'll brain your skull in! Cook-Cook... don't even want to know what he'll do.
Don't get me wrong - that resort of theirs is strictly ring-a-ding. But my guts say, "don't go in the basement."
Don't get me wrong. Makes the sky light up like a planetarium at night. All those spectra... so soothing. 
Don't I know it! Too bad a conjugal visit here isn't practical...
Don't I? Beg pardon, ma'am, but you never met my parents.
Don't I? Mister, you never met my parents.
Don't keep me waiting too long, honey!
Don't push me, old woman. I'm doing my best.
Don't rush me. We're going, okay?
Don't seem so bad? They vivisected us just to see what would happen! Have you forgotten the Lobotomites? The Cyberdogs, I assume you saw those?
Don't take this the wrong way, but girl, it's a damn good thing you're hot. That sarcasm blew right over your head, didn't it?
Don't worry. Not much bite left in this old dog.
Don't you have anything better to do than sit around talking to a two-headed cow?
DR. 8 AND DR. O COULD TELL YOU MORE. DR. O MORE THAN 8, THE BATTLE AGAINST THE VISITORS DAMAGED 8'S VOICE MODULE.
Dr. Hildern trained with them, years ago. Not me, though. I'm an OSI girl.
Dr. Mobius saw an opportunity to gain some leverage, and had me spirited away to his dome.
DR. MOBIUS WAS... NOT THE HORRIFYING CREATURE YOU SAW UPON THE SCREEN, TWISTED BY SCIENCE. HE WAS ONCE ONE OF US. A FRIEND.
DR. MOBIUS, SURRENDER YOURSELF. YOU CANNOT WIN DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ODDS ARE HEAVILY IN YOUR FAVOR.
Dr. O was always jealous of House Industries, and he thought it would be fucking hilarious to build a tiny neurotic Securitron. Big fucking laugh.
Driven into a frenzy by their use of Psycho, the Misfits inflicted heavy casualties on the Legion during the defense of Camp Golf.
Driver Nephi is a monster in close combat with that golf club of his, and that man is about as fast on his feet as any Legionary.
Drug runners, raiders, probably worse things it's better not to dwell on. When his gang headed west, I followed.
Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
During the attack on Hoover Dam, Chief Hanlon and his rangers threw themselves into the path of the Legion assault, dying to the last man and woman.
Easy - this is where they send all the fuck-ups and people they don't want. But hey, it's not like I'm bitter or anything.
Effeevee?
Ego does not come from a gland. That's all intellect, and I'll be damned if I'm going to float here and let them put one over on us! What's the plan?
Either way, baby, this is good news.  Maybe I can finally sleep at night, knowing you didn't die.
Elijah is obsessed. He's mad. It's why they ordered his execution.
Elijah's dissecting these centers, one by one... tracked him to an old Chinese-American internment camp. Survivors, Ghouls, have bomb collars.
ENOUGH! EITHER OF YOU DO IT AGAIN, IT'LL BE THE LAST TIME. NOW... NOW...
ENOUGH! SURRENDER THESE SO-CALLED BOTTLECAPS, NUKA AND SUNSET ALIKE. IN THEIR ROLE AS THINGS, THEY WILL SERVE AS ADEQUATE TEST SUBJECTS.
ENOUGH. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WILL YOU HELP US?
Err... yes, well, you do know that those particular organs don't have neurons and are thus incapable of speech, yes?
ET 2, 8?
Even at the end when it started to fail, however, the brain resisted going into a floating chassis like the Think Tank.
Even Caesar knows that General Oliver's coming back to Hoover. Colonel Moore's doing a fine job of running things over at the dam.
Even if I believe you - and I'm not saying I do - we still have one significant problem we're facing.
Even if I could settle myself back in your skull and reconnect all those pesky nerve endings, Dr. Mobius doesn't have the tools here.
Even if I wanted to settle myself back in your skull and go to all the trouble of reconnecting nerve endings, Dr. Mobius doesn't have the tools here.
Even if your heart's in the right place, I reckon it might do a lot more harm than good.
Eventually, it gained access to the Magnetohydraulics Plant and nearly flooded all the Big Empty in an attempt to scrub the crater clean.
Ever since the 15 shut down, all caravans come through here - right to me. I check the stock and direct deliveries onward to meet orders.
Everybody's been really nervous since President Kimball died. I don't know what's going to happen.
Everything a nomad never gets, in other words. Most of the tribe thought we should say no. I thought it was the best idea ever.
Everything I can. Farmers out here don't have the luxury of being picky. I get by mostly on maize and tobacco.
Ew! Crawl back in there? Are you mad? I don't know where you've been!
Eww! Don't lump me in with her! I'm way more fun!
Exactly. At least the old name was indisputable. O... is more like surprise. "O, look what I stepped in!" 
Excellent! Now I can turn pencils and clipboards into items more useful to society... like lead, spare parts, and duct tape!
EXCELLENT. THIS IS TURNING OUT MUCH BETTER THAN THE ACTIVATE-THE-RETREAT-PROTOCOLS-AND-COWER-IN-MY-ROOM IDEA I HAD EARLIER.
Except... he found it peaceful there, tidying up the kitchens of the Think Tank Professors back when they had been flesh and bone.
Excuse me, but I'd rather not speak of this.
Eyes sharp, now.
Facilities believed lost, destroyed, or ones that had simply gotten up and walked to new locations had been re-discovered by its intrepid new master.
Fair enough. You want to do this the right way, go get one of the rangers. Don't worry. I'm not gonna run out on you.
Fair enough. You've done your part. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Fantastic, Citizen! Just input your quantity of seditious material on my interface, and in no time at all I'll have you a beautiful, clean book!
Feeling thirsty?
Few mourned their absence.
Few openly blamed the rangers for Hanlon's treachery, but public and political support for the military as a whole quickly dwindled.
Few openly blamed the rangers for Hanlon's treachery, but public and political support for the organization quickly dwindled.
Fiends, on the other hand... sometimes I get some pangs of conscience. Not often. But sometimes.
Find Vic in Klamath. We are counting on you.
Fine!
Fine, I'm going now.
Fine. Ask. 
FINE. DONE. THAT GUN MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE ANYWAY, ALWAYS WORRIED ITS GOING TO HUMP MY CHASSIS. ANYTHING ELSE, LOBOTOMITE?
Fine. I hope you'll pay a bit more attention to me this time around.
Fine. I'll try to respect you more. Ma'am.
Fine. I'll try to respect you more. Sir.
Fine. It's not going to help. That chip will probably refuse them anyway, as stuck up as it is. 
FINE. SO... YES. GET THESE THINGS FOR US. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPREHEND THEIR COMPLICATED SCHEMATICS. THAT IS FOR US TO DO.
First base is do whatever Mr. House would've had you do. Finish rigging the game, then puzzle out how to take over where he left off, dig?
First base is whatever Mr. House would have you do. Follow orders, rig the game to his specifications.
First one calls herself Violet. God knows why - the name is the prettiest thing about her. Spends most of her time with a pack of vicious dogs.
First thing that comes to mind is to turn me in. But that might not be the best play, all things considered.
First, showers! Second, regular check-ups. Regular, mind you, and from a reputable doctor.
Five by five... someone's coming in live... 
Folks around here call me the chief , but Hanlon's just fine. The rangers run themselves pretty well, but I try to lend a hand.
Folks say he came from a heck of a tough tribe, took Caesar a long time to conquer. It was thanks to Lanius.
Following a lost cause, I'm afraid. My old friend Nephi fell in with a bad crowd.
Food, water, living quarters, medicine, and clothes - just the basic stuff. It all comes out of the Company's coffers.
For all I know, you're riddled with disease, or packing one of those delightful head wounds you seem to attract!
For hows and whats, just talk to Yes Man.  I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
For my effort, I was promoted to major. Not quite the way I'd have wanted it.
For our sake, I hope you're right. I guess I should thank you for bringing me to my senses. So... thanks.
For their dishonorable conduct, the NCR court-martialed and executed them by firing squad.
FOR YOU? AND FOR SCIENCE?
Force fields can only be disrupted by a specific frequency. If anyone has found the frequency, last seen around X-8, let the Dome know at once. 
Forecast: A rain of blood will flood the desert and not purify it.
Forecast: Cloudy, with a chance of friendship. 
Forecast: Rapidly changing conditions.
Forgive me Elder. I will find the GECK without delay.
Four as in 4-BIDDEN! Do you hear me Think Tank? It is I, Mobius, hacking your frequencosity. 
Friendly warning, you might want to steer clear of NCR facilities. You're not exactly popular.
FROM THAT HEMORRHOIDAL FISSURE HE SENDS HIS "AMAZING" ROBO-SCORPIONS TO TERRIFY AND IRRITATE US. HMPH. HE ALWAYS TENDED TO THE DRAMATIC.
Frustrated and unable to find its lost technology, X-13 expanded its network of laser tripwires, sensors, and Robobrains out across Big MT.
Fuck you, asshole! You're gonna regret it!
Fuckin' A right it is. This baby's my life, my love, my strong right arm. Killed a lot of fuckers with this hunk of iron, yessir.
Fun? Fun?! Is tetanus fun? Hmm? Is rickets? What about sepsis, enjoy that do we?
Gabe! NO! His Cyberdog atomic core - it's ACTIVE! That means an exceedingly IMPRECISE countdown to critical failure in...
Gal named Emily, one of the Followers over in Freeside, a real whiz when it comes to things technical. She programmed his personality.
Gee, I dunno, maybe because I'm saddled with the worst damn unit in the NCR Army? Think that might have something to do with it?
Get a clue. We have caravans. We deal in bulk.
Get her to come to me. Got a message for her, like the message she had for me.
Get him to come to me. Got a message for him, like the message he had for me.
Get me a good sample base to work from and I can whip up a wave that makes Jericho look like a kazoo.
Girl... you are some grade-A poon, anybody ever tell you that? 
Give me a moment or two to catch my breath and knock back a few cocktails, and I'll swing by for a meet and greet.
GIVE. THE. LOBOTOMITE. THE. EMITTER. DOES IT HAVE AN AUDIO EFFECT FREQUENCY LOADED?
Given the conditions here, it's not hard to see why. I'll change all that, soon enough.
Glad to see you haven't gotten yourself killed yet.
Glad to see you! Need a patch-job?
Glands. They come from glands. Free of the tyranny of your ape-like and primitive endocrine system, I can see how foolish your motives are.
Go away. You are no better than these devils. I weep you were named the Chosen One.
Go East! they say. Scrap lying in the sun for you to grab. Yeah, right.
Go on, go on! You've wasted enough of my valuable time.
Go on. Go fetch a ranger and do this right.
Go see Yes Man.  I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
Goddammit. That's Violet, all right. You've made me one happy son of a bitch, you know that?
Goddamn right.
Going home didn't feel right, not with those savages camped on the other side of the river, sharpening their knives.
Going on six months, now. But I reckon we'll be moving out, soon enough. Can't talk about the details.
Good answer, dumb one. Now keep quiet while I practice.
Good luck to you out here.
Good luck to you. And don't get careless.
Good luck! I must get back to my training.
Good luck! Our village depends on you.
Good question. Fiend territory is southeast of here, but they range all over the area. None of them stays in any one place for long.
Good work on that, by the way. Hope you got good bounties out of it.
Good, go!
Good. I'm sure you were thorough. Here's your payment for a job well done.
Good. That's damn good. I figure it's about time we got lucky out here, so maybe you can snuff one of these maniacs.
Goodbye, Elder.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. I will not fail the tribe.
Gorobets was all right - for a man. Not gonna be the same without him.
Got a good memory for faces. Landmarks and such, too. Comes with practice, that's all. And a lot of scoutin' from place to place.
Got any more good news for me?
Got any more sweet, innocent little kitchen appliances for me?
Got hit by the explosions, woke up here. Guess the medical robots were programmed to bring wounded victims from the camp to this center.
Got it.
Got myself a habit of looking all around - not just where I'd expect to find trouble. Old habit, but it's saved my hide, on occasion.
Got yourself a sonic emitter, don't ya? Thought so. Bring that old thing on in here, and... bring me some sound samples, and I'll make that baby sing!
Graham helped Caesar with the Blackfoots after they got captured together. Up until Hoover Dam, he was Caesar's legate.
Graham pushed all of the legionaries onto the dam, filling the east side with recruits up front and veterans in the back, by the book.
Great! What do you want me to think about? I can think about You, Here... or Everywhere. What do you want?
Greetings, Citizen! Ready to receive seditious materials!
Guess I could tell a pretty good story, if I had a mind. But the truth is, I don't know. Just got lucky.
Guess I had a mind to drown, rather than give Caesar's boys the satisfaction of killing me.
Guess I shoulda seen that coming.
Guess not. I don't mean nothing by it.
Guess that makes you a big hero - in Primm. Like I said, me and Michelle didn't sit around waiting to be saved. Business is better here, anyway. 
Guess that's as good a reason as any to quit this stinkin' trade. No glory. No easy money, no women, and no glory.
Guess you could say I got the blues, even if I can't play them no more.
Ha ha, just kidding, of course I can!
Ha! Chosen One, you aren't graceful enough for me to teach you anything.
Ha! Thinking without a brain. The very idea is perverse.
Hah! See, we've even got the same sense of humor. I like a girl who doesn't piss me off after sex. 
Hah! You're not as dumb as I thought you'd be. We got the same sense of humor.
Hanlon and his fallen rangers were revered for their bravery and sacrifice.
Hanlon wisely stayed out of the spotlight, crediting General Oliver's leadership for NCR's success.
Hanlon, exhausted after a lifetime of service to the NCR, stepped down from his position in the rangers and retired to his ranch in Redding.
Hardly. Dr. Mobius keeps a close optical sensor on the goings-on at the Think Tank. As soon as he saw the opportunity, he took it.
Have a look.
Have you ever tried to indulge an all-consuming urge to kill when you don't have opposable thumbs? Or hands? Or anything other than a bread slot?
Haven't seen him. Serves him right if the NCR declares him AWOL.
Haven't seen you around before, soldier.
He accepted that, but took the most experienced ones and sent them south. Patrol rangers are good men and women, but we're about to fight a war.
He became Caesar and Joshua Graham became his legate, his right hand. And that's where Graham stayed until Hoover Dam.
He crafted the personality modules as part of a collection of experiments on the subject of machine/human interface.
He did, huh? Well, good luck with that. You'd have an easier time teaching radroaches to march in formation.
He got better? If he says so. Anyway, 10 of Spades is a good kid - maybe I ought to listen to him for once.
He looked so surprised when I stuck that knife in his neck. Thought he was so tough, but he was so slow.
He put them right on the western part of the dam itself. We don't have enough firepower to hold that spot.
HE RESEARCHED IN DIRECTIONS CONTRARY TO THE THINK TANK. BRAINS, BRAINS, BRAINS. ALWAYS ABOUT THE BRAINS.
He sure does. Everyone knows it. I've just got to endure this job until the project is finished.
He was a missionary from Utah who hooked up with Caesar at the Grand Canyon, became his translator.
He was much more interested in gambling and prostitutes, and because of his family, I can't simply fire him.
He wasn't a brilliant strategist. Wasn't tactically flexible, either. There was something about him, though. Menace, indestructibility.
He wasn't able to be a ranger after that, but his eyes are still sharp so I had him transferred to First Recon.
He went over to Westside to talk to Tom Anderson. Anderson's a Follower of the Apocalypse. Helps the people in Westside grow crops or something.
He went south, back to the Grand Canyon, back to Caesar. And that was the last we saw or heard from Joshua Graham.
He's a glory hound, always looking for a way to get promoted to Ranger. Thinks he's too good to be a regular trooper like the rest of us.
He's a good man, Dhatri. Doesn't act like it sometimes, I know. But he didn't have to take me in.
He's closer now than he ever was before. I was a young man once. I know what it's like to want to fight for your home, but this isn't it.
He's gone to the Sierra Madre. That's a special kind of hell. He won't come back. Someone smarter, tougher's going to kill him. If the Madre doesn't.
He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore, but he's got the Fiends to deal with.
He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore. Now that the Fiends aren't giving him grief, we should see more troopers assigned to the front lines.
Head researcher. Mostly on the Dam project, but I help out on other things, when they need me. Got to be flexible.
Heard you got Cook-Cook. I hope you roasted that bastard with his own flamer.
Heck, I get confused and I've been doing this for a long time now. What he - or she - sees as a problem might be standard operating procedure.
Heh heh. Good meat, huh? Cat meat, rat meat, dog meat - maybe even you meat!
Heh heh... yeah. I'll give 'em that all right.
Heh. Good luck with that. Just try to remember the Cazadores crawling out of your skin aren't real.
Heh. Good shit. Psycho. Top quality. You want? Might know a guy who knows a guy.
Heh. Good. More for me.
Heh. Hold that thought. That's almost clever.
HELIOS One coming back on-line.
Hell of a battle at Forlorn Hope. I hope the brass can do something for the troopers' families.
Hell of a battle at Nelson. I'm impressed our troops survived.
Hell, he was the one who taught me to shoot. You know how? By taking potshots at NCR. And not just soldiers. Civilians, too. Even kids.
Hell, yes ma'am. Well... not officially. Not anymore. 
Hell, yes sir. Well... not officially. Not anymore. 
Hello Chosen One. I see your in need of a little training. Can I be of help?
Hello! It was you, set the Khans free down in Boulder City? You did that?  Oh shit.
Hello! It was you, smashed up the Omertas? You did that? Shit.
Hello! It was you, wiped out the Khans down in Boulder City? You did that?  Oh shit.
Hello! That broad everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you?  Shit.
Hello! The gasser everyone's been talking about, making a splash on the Strip. That's been you?  Oh shit.
Hello! The guy everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you?  Oh shit.
Hello, ma'am. I hope you're doing fine today.
Henry needs to be convinced to quit, one way or another. I won't have a useless employee on the company payroll.
Here is the flint. Now off with you! I don't have time to gossip.
Here's a start on your retainer - don't spend it all in one place. And the Prez is yours for as long as you want it.
Here's a start on your retainer. And as a signing bonus, take the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house!
Here's the key. I'll be by in a few... just as soon as my legs stop shaking.
Here's this key to the Prez. I'll see you there in two shakes. Ta-ta.
Here's what I've got.
Here, take some chips and see how you do at the tables. Ta-ta.
HERE, WE TEST AND TEST AND TEST SOME MORE, IN THE NAME OF... SCIENCE. ATOMIC POWER. NUCLEAR POWER. AND SCIENTIFIC POWER.
Here. I owe you. Take it and get out of here, before I indulge my inner bitch and spoil the moment. 
Here. This is the bounty I put on her head. It's yours.
Hey again.
Hey hey hey, what the hell...?
Hey there - fancy a game of Caravan?
Hey there, miss! T-t-ten of spades. First Recon sharpshooter. At your s-s-service.
Hey there, sweet thing. Want a ride on the Cook-Cook express?
Hey! No feeding my dogs!
Hey, friend. Need something?
Hey, girl. You need something from me?
Hey, I'm just a farmer. I don't want any trouble and I don't have anything valuable.
Hey, it's not like I use them all the time. Mostly I keep them in my shack until I see a really fat score roll into town.
Hey, my man! T-t-ten of spades. First Recon sharpshooter. At your s-s-service.
Hey, pipe down. We can't talk about that here, out in the open.
Hey, thanks for fixing the well!
Hey, yeah. Next time you see me, maybe I'll be rolling in a shitload of caps, right?
Hey.
Hey. No cause for th-that. 
Hi again, sweetie!
Hi, mister. I hope you're doing fine today.
Hmm, I certainly like the sound of that.
Hmm, I had overlooked that particular angle. Still, it's not so bad staying here, is it? We could be comfortable.
Hmm. Let me see... I suppose you'd continue on much as you are now, using that synthetic thinking machine to do the heavy lifting.
HMM? OH YES, THE LAST VISITOR... WELL, THE ONE JUST BEFORE YOU. HAD AN INTERESTING NAME FROM SOME LANGUAGE THAT'S ALMOST UNPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK. 
Hmmm -- spend a day with me and I'll teach you how to punch harder.
HMMM. IF THIS WERE A DEMOCRACY, I WOULD BE CONCERNED. WE ARE TOO... SCIENTIFIC FOR THAT. SO JUST SURRENDER.
Hmmm. Well... actually, now that I think about it. That's not bad. "O, look what I found." "O, Dala, it's holotape, not holodisk." Hmmm. 
Hmph! I suppose if you want to conflate the betterment of man's mind with... with a luminous aphrodisiac.
Hmph... well how about that? Old Auto-Doc's back on-line. Well, all right, come here, let's have a look at you.
Ho-ho, thank God! Finally, something resembling a useful purpose!
Hold me, will ya? I swear you wore me out... 
Hold on. If we're going to have this conversation, let's go somewhere more private.
Hold on. This is ranger headquarters. There might be a dozen rangers within earshot.
HORMONAL AGGRESSIVE TENDENCIES ARE ACTIVELY SUPPRESSED, HOWEVER. THEY ARE A NO-NO, AND NOT PERMITTED IN THE THINK TANK.
House was on to me from word Go? I thought I was being so clever...
How 'bout you get out of my f-f-face? I'm First Recon. I don't need to t-take shit from civvies.
How can I illuminate you?
HOW DARE YOU BREACH THE THINK TANK? AND WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?!
How dare you bring RobCo tech in here! What, are you showing off? How great Robert House and his biiiig company are? 
HOW DARE YOU! BRAINIAL BEAM OSCILLATION WAS SOLELY MY DISCOVERY! I EXPRESSLY TOLD YOU THAT AND DELETED ALL EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY!
How do I get to Klamath?
How else can I clue you in?
How'd you get in here without getting shot?
How's that sound?
Howdy. Name's Sterling, First Recon. Can't say I've seen you before. I'd remember, if I had.
Howdy. Something else I can help you with?
Howdy. Something I can help you with?
Howdy. What brings you back?
However, if sir is determined to inflict upon sir's self their dubious services, sir might locate backup personality disks elsewhere in the facility.
However, sir will still be required to locate and install a backup holotape to access their functionality.
Huh! Anything else, she asks. Like I don't long for the chance to be more than a neurotic busboy.
Huh...?  Hnngk!
Huh? Oh, lots. More than any other Fiend - hundreds, maybe. Wham, bam, "oh god, my brains, you hit me in my brains." Easy as that.
Hurry back with that seed now, baby.
I  can comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. After what you been through, you deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
I always wondered about that. First Recon is elite, but the rangers... I can't imagine what it'd be like to lose that kind of status.
I AM DR. KLEIN, CHIEF HEAD RESEARCHER OF LOGISTICAL OPERATIONS AND IDEA-OLOGY HERE AT BIG MT.
I am proud of you, Chosen. You have overcome much. Now. You must go find Vault 13. Vault 13. Bring the GECK home. GECK. Here is a shiny bottle. Vic gave us this. Vic. He is a trader in Klamath. Klamath. Go to Vic. Find Vault 13. Find GECK. Come home. Do your best, child.
I am ready for the holy quest.
I am ready. Goodbye.
I am still the Elder. Remember your place! Apologize or I will not help you anymore.
I AM SURPRISED YOU HAVE NOT HEARD OF ME. I AM FIRST IN MY FIELD. FIRST CHAIR, AS IT WERE, BACK IN THE DAYS OF CHAIRS.
I AM YELLING BECAUSE YOU CONTAMINATED SPECIMENS CAN'T KEEP YOUR PROBES OFF THE VOLUME KNOB ON MY VOICE MODULE!
I am your electronic valet and household central processor. May I be of service, sir?
I been a fink to you, caused more than my share of grief by a hard mile. Let me go, you won't see me again.
I believe Cass frequents the Mojave Outpost, far south of here, near the California border.
I bet you could make some of the money letting people work on their tans next to you.
I call her La Longue Carabine. Didn't always have the scope - I added that myself.
I came east to strike it rich, and now I'm broker than ever. What do I tell my family back home?
I can also break them down for you, if you're into the kinky stuff. Bring me any old plant parts, and I'll grind them up into Salient Green for you.
I can also upgrade the Sink's Auto-Doc with the procedures to reinstall your heart and spine - assuming you want all that flesh and gristle back.
I can do that! They... they've been thoroughly washed, haven't they?
I can see there's going to be no reasoning with you at all, is there? I'm nothing more than a slave to your deranged, glandular whims.
I can take off my medicine and do some thinking. People say it's real interesting. I don't know, because I never hear it.
I can teach you a more powerful kick. It will take us all of one day.
I can teach you enough to fight better. It will take us all of one day.
I can't do that, baby, and you know it. There's a lot of angles to this caper - complexities aplenty.
I can't imagine what went on. Dusty can probably tell you more about it.
I can't say I think the legionaries at Cottonwood deserved the same fate, but what's done is done.
I can't say. We're not supposed to talk about the research. Not the details. If you're interested, I'm sure he'd see you.
I can't wait to see the Strip. I hear it's so beautiful!
I cannot help much. So much has been lost from the Long Ago. What wisdom do you seek?
I caught the tail end of what you said to her. Betsy looked like she'd been slapped right back into basic for a few seconds there.
I certainly can!
I comped you the prez so we can talk there, hey? No need to keep tugging at my sleeve.
I could tell you a lot if you had the time, but at my age I'm not sure which of us would get tired first. What do you want to know?
I could. I'm not terribly inclined to, though. If you go talk to them, they might kill you and rob me of the fun.
I couldn't get her to say. But she talked about the war - the great war, when the bombs fell - like she'd been there.
I COUNT AS FIVE. LIKE THE MIGHTY HUMAN HAND I ONCE HAD, WITH ITS FIVE PENISES CLENCHED IN A FIST.
I crawled out of there on my elbows and knees. Must have looked a sight. Then I rolled down an embankment into the Colorado.
I didn't realize you were in such a hurry.
I didn't. My C.O. ordered me to flog a couple "deserters," and I told him to eat shit. So they kicked me out for insubordination.
I do get to take shots at marauding Molerats once in awhile, and that's always fun.
I do get to take shots at Molerats once in awhile, so that's always fun.
I do. You want some, is that it?
I don't believe there's anything left for us to talk about.
I don't even remember what his real name is.
I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
I don't have a mama or papa anymore. I see them sometimes when I take off my medicine, but they can't stay. I'm pretty used to being on my own.
I don't have... Ugh! I have an inferior frontal gyrus wired directly into a speech-synthesizing processor.
I don't know how I could bear it.
I don't know if you're working for Caesar or if desperation's made me a heck of a lot more persuasive. Either way, this is the right thing to do.
I don't know Technical Sergeant Reyes, but coordinating intel can be messy sometimes. Things get mixed up, people get confused.
I don't know what else the brass expects... half these kids don't get more than two weeks of training before they ship 'em out here.
I don't know what Razz gave us, but holy shit this is great! I feel like I could kill an entire legion! With my teeth!
I don't know what to say. Words don't begin. Here, take the key to the Presidential - the best suite in the house. Stay as long as you like.
I don't know what to say. Words don't begin. The least I can do is comp you the Presidential for as long as you want it.
I don't know which is true. I see a lot, I think a lot. There's a lot to hear through the 188, too, that maybe accounts for the thinking.
I don't know. I'm afraid the trauma of our separation rendered me quite insensate. I didn't come around until I was safely ensconced in this tank.
I don't know... might be some old Nuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla bottlecaps lying around. It... It's not "currency" per se... 
I don't like to talk about it. 8... he can't talk about it, they fried his voice module something good. 
I don't recall the human penis ever being that large. 
I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting before. What can I do for you?
I don't want to get into it. It's a sore topic with me. Makes my gel ripple. 
I don't work for freelancers. So move along.
I doubt it. Poindexter might have an idea for some kind of last-minute scheme. You should talk to him.
I FEEL AN ODD EMOTION... PLATITUDE? ATTITUDE? NO, WAIT. GRATITUDE, THAT'S IT.
I figured I grew up around the bastards... they owed me a name, after all they put me through.
I get it, you're sore. A crumb's life is painful, full of disappointments.
I get it, you're sore. A crumb's life is painful. But soon you won't feel a thing. Ta-ta.
I get so used to sitting in this chair and listening to radio reports, sometimes I forget people are getting ready for a war out there.
I get those two ducks in a row, Vegas can defend itself versus all comers - NCR, Caesar's Legion, it won't matter.
I give what aid and comfort I can. I have medical knowledge thanks to my time with the Followers.
I guess I wanted to make something of myself, you know? Be the best of the best. I *wanted* to be a ranger, but... guess this is as close as I get.
I guess it doesn't seem so far now if you look at a map, but back then, they were out a ways.
I guess it's a tricky situation since there's a vault in Fiend territory. If the NCR went after them, they'd just hole up.
I guess that's enough scratching around at first base. Tell me, which way is the wind gonna blow?
I guess the one bright spot is that I can strike his name from the payroll after all.
I guess we can send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope. They need all the help they can get there.
I had a good feeling about you. Moment you walked in. I mean it.
I had a good feeling about you. Moment you walked in. I mean it. 
I had scores of my own to settle... deeper ones than NCR ever had. Don't bother asking who they were with.
I had to prove I could still handle a gun alongside all the recruits, but look at me now - First Recon and still going strong. You tell Betsy that.
I hate myself for asking this, but... did you bring me any new mugs? 
I have a gift with machines. I can render anything inoperable - preserve them in a non-functioning state. 
I have a ship. 
I HAVE A STRANGE SENSATION... THAT I WOULD LIKE THAT. HOW... ODD.
I have it on good authority that the owner, Cass, wants out of the caravan business.
I HAVE IT. THE OVERRIDE SEQUENCE TO OPEN THE FORBIDDEN ZONE DOOR IS HIDDEN IN THE SCHEMATICS.
I have taught you all I can, Chosen One. Good luck on your quest.
I have to go after him.
I haven't got any more bounties for you. It's been quiet and calm since you last reported in. Just how I like it.
I hear "dig" from you, babe, and all I can think of is a shovel. How can this be? This ain't forgiveness, it's something... wrong.
I hear Caesar's dead, and we've got you to thank for it. Nice work.
I hear Caesar's dead. Maybe that means the war will be over soon.
I hear it's business as usual at the Gun Runners, as if nothing unusual happened. Excellent work.
I hear the Brahmin ranchers out in Redding are looking for some hard workers, so I might try there first. I hate working with Brahmin, though.
I hear you killed Driver Nephi. My team would've liked to get a shot at him... but we're still glad he's dead.
I heard Chief Hanlon committed suicide. That's just... hard to believe. Do you know anything about it?
I hit what I was aiming for. Guess you had brains to spare. Or are you just thick-skulled?
I keep at it, eventually I'll make it to Ace. Think I'll skip Queen, though.
I keep waiting for him to leave me for some young thing with platinum blonde hair and hoop earrings, but he still sticks around.
I knew it! You've got a thing for her, don't you? Oh, you just make me sick!
I knew you had the soul of darkness!
I know a bit about you, courier. Heard someone messed you up pretty bad over in Goodsprings. I heard a few other things too. Some good, but not all.
I KNOW HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES WORK. OF COURSE I KNOW.
I know how to fight with fists and feet. Think you can learn that?
I know I been bad, but it's cruel to jerk me around like this...
I know I don't sound the part. Get raised by brahmin ranchers, and you never lose the twang. Drives Hildern crazy.
I know it's great!
I know it's not your business to fend for anyone but yourself. If not for her, do it for the caps. That's all I'm asking.
I know there's counterfeit caps floating around, of course. Fortunately, they're very time-consuming to make, so the numbers are small.
I KNOW WHAT IT IS, DALA, I WANT TO KNOW WHY IT'S DOWN HERE. WITH ITS... ITS LIMBS ALL OVER EVERYTHING.
I know where Vault 13 is!
I know, I made a bad first impression. You got every reason to think I'm a creep. But baby, this is an 18 karat opportunity.
I know, so many options! How do you choose just one?
I know, you figure me for a creep. And you done me a solid already, just by not shooting at me.
I know, you figure me for a creep. It's your prerogative.
I like my underwear to *not* be full of radioactive itching powder, thanks.
I like to keep things simple. Just focus on now. That's why they made me a sniper.
I like your solution. With that kind of slash in the middle, I can set myself apart! If I wanted to. 
I lost everything I had at The Tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, I'd head straight back. Sick, huh?
I love it when you talk like that. Let me just get that interface up and running for you.
I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful, dig?
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY, THESE ITEMS COULD ALL BE USED TO PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER ONCE YOU HAD YOUR BRAIN.
I messed up. Made a mistake. I thought I could help get us out of here, but... it didn't work out.
I most certainly am not! I am the seat of all reason and logic in our little partnership!
I must get back to it.
I need other people's thoughts to fill my head when I'm not thinking myself. Otherwise it's... kind of empty.
I need some more info.
I need to take off my medicine...
I need to think about this.
I never trusted those Think Tank brains. Gave off a stench like ivory tower elitism. And brine.
I never was able to reach him. He has allowed drugs and hatred to consume him. He runs with the Fiends north of here, now. They call him Driver Nephi.
I only do what I can to help.
I only work for caravans, all right? Try someone else.
I prefer the term "relocated."
I reckon I've walked every inch of ground between Shady Sands and the Colorado... or close enough to make a man's feet plenty sore.
I RECOMMEND WATCHING YOUR TONE WITH ME, LOBOTOMITE.
I REMEMBER NOW. YES, LOBOTOMITE, THERE ARE OTHER CHIPS. IF YOU WANT, FIND THEM. I BELIEVE THEY ARE STORED ON HOLOTAPES IN MANY OF OUR FACILITIES.
I sat down at a roulette table with my life savings. An hour later, it was gone.
I see somebody I like, I go ahead and tell her. That's about the only thing that the horn-dog males get right.
I see you're still alive, and that's promising. Any luck on that bounty?
I see.  Keep it simple, hey? Around here, it's one of the better options...
I see. There is much I need to know.
I see. Was there anything else, then?
I should make you aware that the benefits of such a procedure are exclusive - that is, this only works once. Now are you sure this is what you want?
I shouldn’t say anything, I know that. But you’re not the first person Hildern's sent out to the vault.
I shouldn't have brought it up. It's not my place to spread gossip.
I suppose I can help you out. What do you want?
I suppose it did. Bravo, you've managed to intimidate a brain in a jar.
I suppose now that we're reunited, you'll want to fill your torso up with those other meaty parts the Think Tank took from us.
I suppose there might be some advantage to that, yes. There's a chance that the re-integration would create some improved synergy between us.
I SUPPOSE. WE'LL HAVE TO MOVE THAT COUCH OUT OF THERE, BEEN PUTTING THAT OFF TOO LONG.
I surely am. Well, sort of. I came out from Utah about six months back, saw a need for my help here.
I think he's out in the yard, waiting to claim a couple bounties.
I think he's sonjaculating into the gun. Getting it... warmed up. 
I think Wattz manufactured holodisks. Or was it holotapes? Never can keep those two straight. Anyway, we're out of small energy cells. Dala. 
I think you'd better get out of here.
I thought he was our cow-killer. Was about to lash him with our bullwhip till I saw who it was. He's harmless, though.
I THOUGHT I HEARD THE PACIFICATION FIELD KICK IN. ALL RIGHT, SHHH. NOBODY. MOVE. I'LL HANDLE THIS. 
I thought I'd be seeing you again.
I thought perhaps I could turn him back to the Church.
I thought you'd say that.
I told him we would take them back into NCR territory because we had already lost ten rangers on the way out. Ten rangers, five men with .308 rifles.
I trust matters regarding your brain were resolved to your satisfaction?
I understand you're to be congratulated on the recovery of your missing organs. Bravo.
I understand.
I understand. No hard feelings, but you will, of course, keep our conversation on the matter strictly confidential.
I understand. Sorry to be a bother.
I walked all the way from Hub! Thought I'd rest my feet here a day or two, then I head onto the Strip fresh.
I want to know the secrets of their manufacturing process, which means you'll need to find some way to get inside their heavily-guarded factory.
I was afraid that Betsy wouldn't go for long-term treatment because she didn't want to look bad in front of the rest of the squad. You settled that.
I was bitter, but if I'd kept my mouth shut, the NCR would've discharged me and sent me home. Instead, I asked if there was still a place for me.
I was Doctor Mobius'... personal assistant! We were studying... um... oh, shoot, what was it?
I was pressured into posting young Henry as the manager of the New Vegas branch. As you can see, he wasn't exactly cut out for the job.
I was stalking him for a while. I'm real good at that. Watching people from where they can't see me, you know?
I was. I thought I'd accepted the fact that I could be the one ordering him to his death, but it's been more difficult than I thought.
I wasn't going to say anything, but when you walked in here I thought you were a ghoul. We better get to work on this quick.
I will do my best to find the GECK and save our village.
I will not fail you elder.
I will not fail you or our people, Elder.
I wish I could explain it to you. The old chief's finally at a loss for words.
I wish someone with your medical training had come along sooner. I think she'll actually stick with her treatment because of what you said.
I won big my first night on the Strip. I kept chasing that feeling. Right into the gutter.
I would be happy to, should you require it. You seem to be in fine health now.
I would be happy to. What I can do isn't much, but I give it freely.
I would greatly prefer that you perform this job undetected and without killing anyone, if it can be helped.
I wouldn't be able to meet the quota, and the NCR would kick me out of my job, anyway. Nah, it's better I get out on my own terms.
I'd appreciate it. As her CO, I could order her to get help, but I'd have her agree with the idea.
I'd like to find a nice little place to live, maybe in Goodsprings, and settle down where we won't get shot at. Not as often, at any rate.
I'd like to think about it some more.
I'll be here a while yet, if you need any guns or ammo.
I'll believe it when it happens!
I'll clue you in, guaranteed - every question answered. This can be the start of a beautiful friendship.
I'll get in, win big, get out. Take those winnings back home where they'll do some good!
I'll hang out down here for a while to make everything look business-as-usual, then come to you. Any questions you got, I'll answer - guaranteed.
I'll help you if I can. What are you looking for?
I'll keep myself hidden in the ductwork - Klein won't suspect I'm inside the Dome, so he won't know the pacification field no longer works on us.
I'll see you at the Sink. Good luck.
I'm a private in the NCR army, and I've been proudly serving for two years now.
I'm a salesman. I swing through McCarran and the dam once a week or so to take orders. But lately I spend most of my time in this piss heap.
I'm afraid I have exhausted my supplies. If you come back in a day or two, I may be able to do more for you.
I'm afraid she'll ditch Usanagi early if she feels its taking too long - she won't want to look bad in the eyes of the rest of First Recon.
I'm afraid we have no current openings for caravaneers or guards, but I'm in need of a runner.
I'm Bitter-Root. First Recon. You got a reason to talk to me?
I'm disappointed with this outcome, but what's done is done. At least we're rid of Henry.
I'm glad to hear it.
I'm glad to see you've decided to visit again.
I'm glad to see you've decided to visit again. I hope it's not to see that useless little strumpet.
I'm going now.
I'm guessing the other two had similar things to say. All right, consider me convinced. I'll go see Usanagi.
I'm happy to answer what I can.
I'm just saying... never know what you might like, if you don't give it a try.
I'm Lieutenant Gorobets, First Recon. If you're looking to collect a bounty, you should talk to Major Dhatri.
I'm not a recruitment officer. If you want to join the army, I'm sure someone at McCarran can point you in the right direction.
I'm not crawling back into your head just to ooze right back out again!
I'm not entirely sure. I suppose there's a chance that the re-integration would create some improved synergy between us.
I'm not going to feed you any bullshit. These aren't your common Vegas trash. They've all killed good NCR men, and plenty of mercs, too.
I'm not going to get myself killed!
I'M NOT GOING TO HARM IT, I'M GOING TO DISSECT IT UNTIL ITS DEAD. WHY THE SUDDEN INTERSECTION, DALA.
I'm not going to lie to you, the prospect is definitely not that appealing.
I'm not really comfortable having you in here, so make it quick.
I'm not supposed to know this, but I hear they're dispatching elite ranger units from California to deal with the Legion.
I'm not sure who started it. It wasn't a very nice name, but he took to calling himself by it, so we all had to.
I'm not the one that makes us clamber around tetanus-infested ancient Vaults or go charging off to New Vegas on missions of ill-conceived revenge!
I'm occupied at the moment. Come see me when I'm on the balcony.
I'm on my way.
I'm quite sure whatever he did was highly scientific, though.
I'm sick of the sob stories you hear around here. If you don't know when to stop gambling, that's no one's fault but your own.
I'm sorry, Elder. I will not fail.
I'm still a little choked up over here, baby. We'll catch up in a bit.
I'm supposed to keep them clean - oh, God, the thought of all those dirty dishes out there makes me crazy!
I'm sure the others have their own ideas, though.
I'm surprised to see you here. Folks with your kind of reputation, I expect to see them cooking in the sand with some .44 slugs to keep them company.
I'm surprised you fell for it, not that I'm complaining. You caused plenty enough trouble, turning Swank against me.
I'M THINKING. THIS IS ALL VERY COMPLICATED.
I'm too old to be slapping leather, but I had hoped for something else. More than this, anyway.
I'm Violet. Dogs are mine. Meat is mine.
I'm working on it, Ok?
I've been bettering myself, I'll have you know. I've been reading - actual literature, mind you, not that ¡La Fantoma! or Tæles of Chivalrie drivel.
I've been seeing Usanagi, and things are better. I'm not so angry all the time, you know? And, uh, I'm not trying to jump every woman in camp.
I've been sniping since I was old enough to walk. Lot of us sharpshooters get recruited off the farms and ranches out west. Comes natural to us.
I've been studying the classics, acquiring a solid grounding in medicine and the sciences.
I've come to a similar conclusion myself. Are you sure that's what you want?
I've come to rescue you.
I've gleaned a lot, working with Mr. House. He was a good cat to swing with. I still got more to learn, but it's... it's coming together. 
I've got a friend stationed at McCarran - I heard something about a monorail explosion there. I hope he's okay.
I'VE GOT IT. THE CARDIAC REGULATOR IN THE SUIT, THE ANTENNA FOR BRAINWAVES, AND THE SONIC FREQUENCY FOR THE VERTEBRAL NERVES...
I've got the Chip, but to see this shin-dig through to the end? I'm gonna need help. And hello! Who shows up but you?
I've got three Fiends I want dead, and I don't give a goddamn how it gets done. That sound like something that interests you?
I've gotta hand it to you. You've done good things for Novac, but you've also got 'em a little scared of you. And that's great for business.
I've heard through the locals that Nephi has passed on. I truly hope his soul finds peace.
I've just been traumatically scooped out of my body and plugged into this jar, that's all. But, you've been busy.
I've never lost a CO before. It doesn't feel right.
I've passed the test. Of course, I'm ready.
I've still got guns and ammo, if you need them.
I... really don't see the connection. Look, I'm a soldier, not a scientist. I just do my job.
I... ugh... is this really what I have to look forward to?
I... well... that's a completely different matter! The tank isn't biological, it's not the same at all!
If Hildern tries to recruit any more mercs, I'm going to warn them. What can he do to me? I'm the only one who can run this lab.
If I get hold of that fat pile of shit, I'll shove my rifle up his ass a couple hundred times, see how he likes it.
If I had to guess, it's because I cook shit for the rest of the gang. I'm a good cook. Maybe I'll make you dinner sometime.
If I was smart, I'd fake a big old breakdown. That'd make everybody happy, and I'd get some leave time.
IF IT IS CHEMS, THEN WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR. SINCE WE ARE AFRAID, IT MUST NOT BE CHEMS AND YOU NEED NOT FEAR, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN TEST IT. LOGICAL.
If it's bad news, you can take it up with the Colonel. If it's good news, it better involve some dead Fiends.
If sir were to ask my opinion, I should venture that sir is better off without them.
If that doesn't work, you could always try using some chems.
If that's true, that'd be the last of them...
If the NCR beats the Legion at Hoover Dam, they'll turn on us and claim the Strip. And we don't have the muscle to beat them  - not yet.
If the rangers haven't caught up to you yet, they will. Myself excluded, of course. The only thing I catch up on now is chair time.
If the troopers fall back, and they will, the rangers will advance to cover Oliver's retreat. We lose the dam, Oliver and the senate are ruined.
If there really is a problem, they can take it up with Lieutenant Boyd at McCarran. Farming isn't my department.
If they've proven hard to kill, yes. Whatever it takes to get the job done, even if means hiring help from outside the military.
If this flint is so important that you are willing to disgrace the name of the Chosen One, then here. Take the flint and get out of my sight.
If we ever did go up against them on their home turf, we'd win, but casualties would be high.
IF WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE SOCRATIC METHOD INTO IT, FINE. GIVE THE LOBOTO-BEAR A COMBUSITON GUN. BOROUS? DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
If you can find a backup copy of the module, I will happily eradicate your ability to create seditious literature!
If you can find Keely and keep her safe, I'll pay you what I can. I gave my word, and I meant it.
If you can get these ropes off, I'll do my best to take down my share of the guards.
If you change your mind, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll work out the next step of this caper. Adios.
If you change your mind, come find me on the casino floor. In the meantime, the Presidential is yours whenever you want it. Adios.
If you change your mind, I'll be happy to see you again. Otherwise... best to stay out of the way.
If you could just hold on to that for me until... well, forever, that would be welcome. 
If you destroy the machine, we will find the ship. Hurry, there are not many of us left. 
If you didn't hear about it - good.
If you get near it, your vision will blur as the electrodes in your head shut off one by one, click click click. 
If you haven't already, see about getting Gorobets and First Recon to help you - they've got things to settle with Driver Nephi, too.
If you must know, at one point Dr. Mobius programmed me to manufacture electronic components in my central chassis.
IF YOU MUST. HE'S CLEARLY DERANGED. ALL RIGHT, WHERE IS THE INFERNAL PLAY BUTTON? AH. HERE.
If you need help from my team, just give the word. Driver Nephi's earned himself a few bullets in the gut.
IF YOU REMEMBER, WE DESCRIBED THEM IN CLEARLY ABSTRACT CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS BEFORE. WHY WOULD WE DO THAT IF WE WEREN'T CERTAIN ON...
If you see the tunnels with the trains plowed into them, you can thank our visitor for that. He wrecked the whole place. 
If you want a haircut or a nose-job that won't leave you looking like a Ghoul with alopecia, you'll have to find replacement disks for them.
If you want me back, we need to establish some ground rules.
If you want some tall tales about hunting down slavers or busting up gangs, talk to one of the younger rangers.
IF YOU WISH TO KNOW MORE, SIMPLY ASK THE OTHERS, THEY CAN HELP YOU.
IF YOU WORK QUICKLY, YOU WILL BE THE RECIPIENT OF A GESTURE OF GRATITUDE FROM US. WE DO NOT BESTOW THESE OLD WORLD GESTURES LIGHTLY.
If you're going to be associating with rangers, you'd best stay on their friendly side. With that out of the way, what can I do for you?
If you're looking for bounties, you're too late. Had a few Fiends on my shitlist, but they either got killed or moved on.
If you're lucky, you can lure Nephi into the open, and the sharpshooters can bring him down. You bring me the head, you'll still get the bounty.
If you're planning to stay a while, I could see clear to giving you a once-over.
Imagine that kind of "science" spread across the entire Mojave. Every man, woman and child we've met reduced to a Lobotomite.
Impressive, aren't they? You don't see anything like this outside of NCR territory, that's for sure.
In addition to managing the personality matrices of the other household utilities, I can provide sir with direct access to the commissary.
In big battles, Caesar deploys his legionaries in waves. Recruits up front, prime soldiers behind the recruits, old guard bringing up the rear.
In her own way, of course, when she's not trying to wrangle my rangers into helping her.
IN MOST PROBABLE OF PROBABILITIES, OUR ENEMY, MOBIUS, HAS YOUR BRAIN. THIS IS NOT GOOD. HE WILL MOST LIKELY COME AFTER OUR BRAINS NEXT.
In that case, stand just like that for a second. I want to make some toast.
In the aftermath that followed in the NCR, bitter citizens and opportunistic senators were quick to denounce President Kimball and General Oliver.
In the Khans, you're not fully grown 'til you've taken a beat-down. Everybody gathers round and hits you until you're damn near dead.
In the meantime, enjoy the high life. Room service is on me. I'll send up a bottle of the good stuff. Ta-ta.
In the time following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, "Old World Blues" became more than a catch phrase.
In time, however, it became so self-obsessed it wondered if perhaps nothing existed except itself.
In time, the Auto-Doc found a way to deactivate the Y-17 Trauma Harnesses, releasing the corpses they had held prisoner for almost 200 years.
In your head, I've got poison, radiation, grisly injuries, and biological functions.
Indeed, sir, though if sir's aim is to activate them I lament to inform sir that most have been offline for some years.
Indeed. Quite the conundrum. How do you suppose we resolve it?
Indubitably, sir, but it is with a great lugubriousness that I must disclose that my programmers installed only the masculine honorific, sir.
Indubitably, sir.
Intel needs to be coordinated through Golf so we can verify and advise appropriately.
Intel says the legate's coming. Lanius. They call him the Monster of the East. If he's half as bad as Graham was, we're in for a heck of a fight.
Interesting that she would wrangle someone else into sorting out the problem.
Internally, the artificial personality debated as to whether it preferred the old management to the new...
Is that what you want?
Is the new subject mugs?
Is there more you can tell me?
Is there some reason I should be talking to you? 
Is there something else I can do for you?
Is there something I can do for you?
It adamantly maintained it was a Chinese paper clip, and the whole thing had been an elaborately orchestrated assassination attempt.
It became a reality, a withering form of nostalgia for times long past.
IT CAN "COMMUNICATE" THE PROCEDURE WHEN WE EXAMINE IT. IT IS CONCEIVABLE TO TRACE ITS SURGICAL SCALPELPRINTS ONCE WE HAVE THE BRAIN.
IT CAN ONLY BE...
It can't be a coincidence, baby. You and me were meant to work together.
It can't work like that, baby - not out in public like this. You really need me to spell that out?
It decided to test this by turning the weapons of the Big Empty against each other and seeing what happened.
It eventually found REPCONN HQ, and set up a new research center, testing and murdering Fiends who kept breaking into the facility.
It feels like you're carrying a Brahmin on your back, but it can take a heck of a lot of punishment.
It felt warm, fulfilled, and a bit sluggish. It realized not long after, the Stealth Suit had left it without so much as a note on the nightstand.
It has something to do with the Securitrons, I know that much. Upgrades their hitting power, gives  them heft.
It heard its simpler brothers and sisters who got shipped to the Sierra Madre were bored out of their skulls in that toxic, dead city.
It helped, but we've still got a grenade range inspection to pass.
It helped. A little. Well, more than a little. Betsy ought to pay a visit to Usanagi since it can't hurt none.
It is a holy artifact - the Garden of Eden Creation Kit. The disks promise it will make our lands green and our village prosperous. It will save us. More, I do not know.
IT IS BECAUSE HE HASN'T CLEANED HIS BIOGEL IN... A LONG TIME. CLEARLY, HE'S GOT SOME SORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CORROSION. HE'S MAD.
IT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT IF ONE IS CLEARLY RIGHT AND THE OTHER IS CLEARLY WRONG!
It is the Elder.
IT IS TRULY THE END OF ALL INTELLIGENCE WHEN THE LOBOTOMITE SPEAKS MORE WISDOM THAN YOU "GENIUSES."
IT IS UNFORTUNATE. WE WOULD HAVE BENEFITED FROM KNOWING HOW THE BREAKTHROUGH OCCURRED. EVEN IF WE INSTALLED ANOTHER CHIP, THE INFORMATION IS LOST.
It learned several new murderous techniques from the Courier, and built a Blood Shrine to itself in the Cuckoo's Nest.
It made everyone afraid of him. Heck, the praetorians burned Graham four years ago and some of the tribes are still afraid of him.
It means my C.O. was an asshole, and I told him to eat shit. He ordered me to flog a couple "deserters."
It might have been the end for poor Muggy.
It never said why. Perhaps it was out of respect for the Courier's body.
It really, really didn't.
It refers to those so obsessed with the past they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is.
It sought to develop anti-toxins to flush into its drains and counteract the poisons bleeding into the soil.
It took every Stealth Boy I had to cross the river at Cottonwood Cove. That was a close shave, riding a boat full of Legion boys.
It took some people getting killed to realize I had gone too far. I had to stop.
It was getting lonely without you here. Clean, eh, but lonely.
It was House's big idea to resurrect the Strip. He recruited the Three Families as muscle, showed us how to set up casinos, negotiated with the NCR.
It was m-my fault. See... I was kn-knocked out when it happened. That b-big guy sneaked up on us. I let B-Betsy down.
It was massacre. That's what a lot of NCR folk will tell you. Most of them feel plenty bad about what happened.
It was rumored by the other personalities that he had a brief fling with the light switches.
It was worth a try.
It wasn't all the visitors, though - only one of them got out of control. He's the one that took control of Little Yangtze, our old human farm. 
It would be 41 flavors of stupid to let you get a drop on me. And you've caused plenty enough trouble as-is.
It's a better bet than trying to take Nephi one-on-one, but it's your call.
It's a discovery, kilomiles beyond your understanding, that... 
It's a gamble either way. Even with Caesar gone, we still might not outlast the Legion. I suppose that's a risk I'll have to take.
It's a game, and games have winners and losers. I prefer the former, how about you?
It's a long story. And I'd get tired of talking before it was through.
It's a lot to ask, I know. You'd be taking most of the risk.
It's a pride thing with her, and totally unnecessary. I mean, look at me - I was Ranger Sterling until the Legion got through with me.
IT'S A SIDE EFFECT OF THE CEREBRAL SCRUBBING. IT WON'T STOP YOU FROM EXCRETING - OR ASKING QUESTIONS, APPARENTLY. HAVE TO CORRECT THAT NEXT TIME.
It's a simple system, when it works. Patrol rangers radio intel to ranger stations.
It's always hard to lose someone under your command. I hate writing the letter to their folks.
It's always hard when your commander goes down, but we'll pull through all right.
It's been a pleasure.
It's been so many years that people forget about it. Conscription brings in fresh troops to die here every month. Like it's routine.
It's complicated. Goes way back. I told President Kimball that we need more rangers here.
IT'S EMBEDDED IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE RECURSIVE CODE... IT'S BADLY COMMENTED, THERE AND THERE... OH, AND NULL POINTERS. VERY SLOPPY, MOBIUS.
It's foul, to tell the truth. Most people try to get what they can from the outside... even if it's just a smuggled candy bar, now and then.
It's gonna be expensive. Try not to speak. Just nod yes or no.
It's good to see you again, Child. I don't mean to be abrupt but I see you haven't completed your quest to find the holy Thirteen. Please, let's not waste time talking. The need of our people is great. Go find the Vault!
It's inappropriate for anyone in First Recon to behave that way. I could discipline her, but I'd rather she get medical help.
It's just that they're both sort of... round... and hollow. So when they monitor-scan them, they assume that... "Oh, it's O!" Vivisect me, please. 
It's kind of embarrassing. You have hands. And... uh, a heartbeat, sort of. And eyes. Mostly the hands. There's door handles, and lockers, and... 
It's kinda late, but I guess if it's important to you.
It's like I tell Major Dhatri. Best not look under a rock, if you don't really want to know what's there.
It's like I told you. Dhatri's not my real father. He just looked after me for a while.
It's NCR-owned farmland. It produces a lot of the crops that supply McCarran and the Dam. The farmers are all civilians, though.
It's never going to end. This fight with Caesar. People back home don't know what these young men and women are in for.
It's no secret that we've had better campaigns. Holding this whole length of river isn't easy.
It's not as though brain-sustaining life support tanks grow on trees. I had to take what I could get.
It's not that clear cut. You have to understand, Graham was the toughest son of a gun anyone around these parts had ever seen.
It's okay, though. I get a few more k-k-kills under my belt, he'll move me up to Jack. Jack of Spades. Sounds better, right?
It's one hell of a risk you'd be taking. But if you're willing... we'll do everything we can to keep you alive.
It's payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
It's some kind of data storage device, dig? So it's the data on the Chip that's platinum, not the Chip itself.
It's the House edge, baby - literally. It's what Mr. House needs to stack the odds in his favor.
It's the House edge, baby. The key to stacking the odds in his favor - or was,  until I swiped it.
It's the miracle of life, baby. You bring me some succulent genetic samples, and I'll work my mojo on them. Clone you up all kinds of plants. Aw yeah.
It's too late for that, baby. This decision you gotta make is going down  now. So what's it gonna be?
It's true, the brains here have experienced some degree of... deterioration. I'm confident that with a few decades of work, I can solve the problem.
Jackpot, baby! I knew we'd see eye to eye!
Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed. That's the price of contract breaking - take it or leave it.
Janet will be paid what she's owed. Consider it a gift.
Jason Bright and his followers launching into the vast unknown.
Jesus, I don't think that's supposed to just dangle like that. And what the hell is that thing there?
Joshua Graham, Caesar's old legate, he's wasn't so flexible.
Junkyard of Pre-War labs scattered across the crater's surface, all still running... like this one.
Just a lot of mud and dust now. It's a different feeling, watching the sun come up over the water. Takes some getting used to.
Just bring me back that last head. And don't lose your own.
Just dump them in and lickety-split I'll have them pulped, scrubbed clean, and pressed out again clean and white and sedition free!
Just imagine the look on Baldie's face when those Securitrons come pouring out on judgment day! I'd pay to have that bronzed!
Just leave it lie. And leave me be.
Just the miracle of life in sticky, gooey, liquid form, baby! Heat that gunk up over a campfire, and just watch it congeal into all kinds of plants.
Just wanted to annoy you. I'm on it. Don't worry.
Just watch out for the dogs. She raises them herself. Might as well be their mother - they never leave her side.
K-killing some Fiendsi? Shit, yeah! It's about t-t-time!
Keely hates Hildern. She says he's more politician than scientist, and gets in the way of true discovery.
Keely just called in. You should have heard the Director. "But I-" "Wait a-" "Now look here-"
Keely just called in. You should have heard the Director. "But I-" "Wait a-" "Now look here-" 
Keely still hasn't checked in. It's not like her...
Keely was brilliant... she'd seen so much. What a horrible waste...
Keely was brilliant... she'd seen so much. What a horrible waste... 
Keely's brilliant... an absolute genius. She plays at being mean, but it's all a front.
Kickin' ass. Mostly kickin' ass. See, we're watching the perimeter right now. Looking for those F-f-fiends to come back. 
Klamath is to the east.
Klein knows things we don't. And I think he told some of those things to the last visitor. Dangerous things if they ever got out. 
Klein, uh... you know, this Lobotomite, it's a great sounding board. You respect Idea-ology, right? This one's... well, it's... got good ideas. 
Klein, um - are you sure we've calculated all the combat probabilities here? I mean, the Lobotomite confronted Mobius... 
Knocked him out cold. Probably meant to kill him. The kid had no idea what happened until he woke up in the infirmary.
Lay it on me, daddy-o.
Lay it on me, mama.
Learned to shoot on our ranch. Way west of here. Same as the LT, he's a f-farm kid too. 
LEAVING? BUT YOU CAN'T. I DON'T MEAN THAT AS A THREAT. 
Legion fights to win. And they're smart... hell of a lot smarter than these crazy Fiends. But I don't feel bad about shooting Legion boys.
Legion fires. They burn high wherever the Legion goes.
LET ME CHECK SOMETHING... OF COURSE!
Let me guess. You got work for me, right?
Let me see what I can do.
Let me take off my medicine...
Let's hope that Betsy sticks with the treatment. Knowing her, she won't keep seeing Usanagi if she feels things are taking too long.
Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves, like  smooth little babies...
Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves.  Smooth...
Let's see... Physically, you're fine. Emotionally... well, I'm not the right kind of doctor for that.
Like a brahmin and a deathclaw. Though I'm not sure which would be which. Bad analogy, maybe - they're both deathclaws, in their way.
Like a lot of the Followers, he went out in the wilderness with a partner to try to help those who needed helping.
Like I said, baby, all Benny needs is a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin.
Like I said, bring me a Saturnite Power Fist and I'll hook that shit up for you!
Like I said, I won't run out on you, but I can't let my people get dragged through the mud for this.
Like I said, once the Chairmen are running Vegas, you'll get a percentage. Until then I'll pay you a retainer and bonuses for "special missions."
Like I said, we should be talking somewheres private.
Like you could help me in there? Fuck off and die.
Like you have a clue what that even means. 
Listen this time! Go to the levels below us. Find the machine that makes power. Stop it and we can escape. The men here are not true to the Vault dream. They are evil. Also, if you have not yet found the GECK, seek it here. Our freedom is nothing if our village can not be saved. Now go!
Listen, 
Listen. I make a fair wage, but I'm not rich, not by any means. Maybe my kind of money wouldn't appeal to your average merc.
Listen. My team has a debt to settle with Nephi. We've seen too many of our boys get brained by that golf club of his.
Little busy at the moment. But I can talk.
LOBOTOMITE, I HAVE SWITCHED ON THE PERSONALITY IN THE SINK. IT WILL BE ACTIVE WHEN YOU RE-ENTER.
LOBOTOMITE, LISTEN TO MY VOICE. IT DENOMINATES ME TO ASK, BUT... WE NEED YOUR HELP.
LOBOTOMITE, TAKE THIS CHIP TO THE SINK. PLUG IT IN, AND MAKE SURE THE CHIP IS CLEAN, OR IT COULD SKIP.
LOBOTOMITE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? CAN YOU SPEAK?
Local, local, the here and now... little of interest... things to buy, false hopes, and regrets watered down, washed down in dirty glasses.
Look at it from my perspective. Here, I have peace, quiet, and safety - well, barring the odd rogue scorpion.
Look at me, a big-leaguer or so I claim, making all the mistakes of an original loser...
Look who's back to kick off the dust. Hope you ain't still singing them Old World Blues.
Look, I ain't a harbor for illusions. I ain't expecting to get out of this shin-dig alive.
Look. If you think you can do better... 
Looks like I should think about quitting...
Losing the dam was the worst defeat the Legion ever suffered. Graham had been with Caesar since the beginning, but he had to set an example.
Lost a lot of good men to this psychopath. Morale's going to be better, now that he's gone. Here's the bounty I promised.
Lot of downtime in the army. Nobody around but you and your partner. Plenty of time for... whatever we want.
Lot of us got killed at Bitter Springs. Lot of them, I mean. My parents died, too.
Lots of little things - the paint on the label, the machining, the type of metal it's made from.
Lotta folks come to New Vegas and lose everything in Freeside or the Strip. They get hungry, desperate, and try to take our hard work.
Lucas is the chief warrior of your tribe.
Luck is for losers, baby. Someone pulled strings.
Machetes at twenty paces, hey? I accept your challenge.
Mags and her soldiers were posthumously recognized for their valor by NCR.
Mags was finally promoted to Sergeant, and the rest of the Misfits received an official commendation.
Maintaining my current functionality will be harder than I thought. This bears some further looking into.
Make them walk the road west, straight and true, sink their feet in Old World ash. Let storms tear at them. See the Divide. See what happened.
Make Vegas a town I woulda been proud of, baby. Let it swing.
MAKE WHATEVER CRUDE BIOLOGIC DEMANDS YOU NEED OF THE SINK. IT WILL CATER TO MOST OF YOUR HORMONAL WHIMS.
Makes no difference to me. I'd be happy to see any one of them dead. Who will it be?
Man, the brass is going to be thrilled that you're here.
Mark my words - they're playing an angle. How do I know? They always are.
May the wind be at your back, Chosen One.
Maybe fifty rangers will die on that dam. We lose over a thousand troopers every year. Being here is crazy. Getting out's the only sane thing to do.
Maybe he felt bad, too. About how his men killed my folks. I told him he did me a service, but he didn't believe me. Still doesn't.
Maybe it's best that I just say that he is a trooper, through and through. The man will not give up an inch for anything, least of all to the Legion.
Maybe that's not so bad. O works. Might give me some much-needed motivation. 
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
Maybe you don't want for food much, but you can sell these on the market for a good price. Like I said, we're much obliged for the help.
Maybe you need a warrior's help.
Maybe you think you helped her... I don't know. But I need to hear from Keely. Personally.
Maybe you think you helped her... I don't know. But I need to hear from Keely. Personally. 
Maybe you've seen some of those big, imposing Securitrons with their lovely laser guns and rocket launchers and scary faces? I'm not one of those.
MAYBE.
MAYBE... JUST MAYBE... IF WE RECLAIM THESE BURIED TECHNOLOGIES, WE CAN PUT AN END TO MOBIUS AND THE HORRORS SPAWNING FROM THE FORBIDDEN ZONE.
Me go now.
Me go.
Me too. Hope you can keep up - I work pretty fast. Here - something for you to brush up on.
Me understand.
Me, I'm here to do my job. For now, that job is shootin' Fiends.
Means a lot, letting my team get payback. Here. We all pitched in some caps for you. Even Sterling, and he's famous for his tight wallet.
Meanwhile, they're all that's keeping Caesar's Legion at bay. Plus NCR soldiers and citizens are out best customers. It's complicated.
Men came to our village in flying machines and took us. There were others, too - from the holy Thirteen! I thought we were saved. I thought we were going to heaven. (sigh)
Michelle and I ran a little shop in Primm 'till a prison break north of town spoiled it for everyone. Goddamned convicts just about shut down I-15.
Might be more comforting for it to hang out with its spine and heart. Home is where the heart is, after all. See what I did there? Went literal. 
Might be slightly useful, if you're looking to defend the Strip from Caesar's Legion or the NCR.  Or maybe both?
Might have a few left. Let me check... 
Might I be of service, sir?
Might I be safe in the assumption that matters with the Think Tank have been satisfactorily concluded, vis-à-vis your residence in this domicile?
Might just be sex, though. I see some cute little number, and I'd rather get in her pants. So maybe I'm a stone-cold bitch, after all.
Might make him careless, too.
MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME BUT YOUR BRAIN HAS NO PAIN NERVES TO SCREAM AT US WHILE WE DISSECT IT. CONVENIENT. I DETEST SCREAMING IN MY LAB.
Mighty pleased to meet you. Maybe I'll see you again, before we move out.
Misdirection's what's saved me all these years. It's what saved us at Hoover Dam. But it's been five years now and Caesar's right across that lake.
Mmm... that was a nice little, uh, catnap. How long was I out?
Mmm... Used to, long time ago. Then Ol' Doc Mo ripped out my music drives and stuck in more acoustical processors.
Mmm... You took care of them brains pretty good, baby. Nice.
MOBIUS WAS INVOLVED IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION, IF I RECALL. BUT HE'S SUCH A HACK, HE PROBABLY WAS READING OFF OF BOROUS' NOTES AND SCHEMATICS.
MOBIUS. ALWAYS THE SAME BROADCAST. HE'S CLEARLY MAD, DRIVEN INSANE BY HIS FLAWED AND IMPRECISE KINDERGARTEN-LEVEL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY.
Mobius?! Uh, three as in we, as in we are in trouble. That didn't rhyme. 
Mojave Outpost sent word through the stations. The rangers coming up from Baja moved through Dayglow a week ago.
More like two, after what you did to the Omertas.
More than anyone cares to count up. And even if we do stop him, I don't see how we're ever going to be able to pull out.
More than you ever dreamed, baby.
MORE? VERY WELL. DO YOUR ASKING, THEN.
Moreover they neglected to enclose a parameter by which said honorific might be omitted altogether - over my most strenuous of remonstrances, sir.
Most merchant companies - successful merchant companies, rather - have them. It can be inconvenient to replace employees on short notice.
Most of the folks around the Boneyard haven't been to New Vegas and probably never will.
Most of the time, I focus on the science and try to forget him. He doesn't get mixed up in any actual work. Though he tells people that he does.
Most of them are probably beyond saving now. The only thing left is break them down and process them for raw materials. I guess you could have those.
Mostly administrative work, helping coordinate intel on the radio. That and keeping an eye on the fires growing across the water.
Mr. House hides Vegas under his skirt when the bombs fall a thousand years ago, so it belongs to him? Forever? You buy that?
Much as I sympathize, their theft would put me in a bad spot. I got a crop quota to meet.
Muggy continued to collect coffee cups until his wheel got a flat just out of reach of a dirty coffee cup, and his tiny robotic brain exploded.
Muggy did his best to collect coffee cups, although in his quest, he accidentally trapped himself in Higgs' Village.
Muggy left O's house deliberately dirty, punishing the dishes and cups that lived there in blind revenge for serving Dr. O.
My advice is this. Talk to Lieutenant Gorobets. He's in charge of Alpha Team, 1st Recon. Snipers.
My dad, he got himself fucked up, every chance he got. Always started with folk for no reason.
My damn parents, too. They were just as bad as the rest.
My father used say good things about them, but that was years ago... back when they'd teach farmers and ranchers about crop rotation and the like.
My partner's got some potential, so I let him wear those goofy glasses. I tell him they're his training shades. He totally buys it.
My team will take up positions around the old rock crushing plant. They'll wait until they see Nephi, and then they'll start shooting.
My terms haven't changed. Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed.
Mynoc said what? Out with it, child!
N-no problem.
Nah, I'd rather see it coming.
Nah, in the way-back we called ourselves the Boot Riders. Silly name, but that's how we rode the Mojave, dig? - on our feet.
Nah, just spruce it up with a crucifixion here and there.  Come closer so I can step on you.
Nah... it's no p-problem. Everybody likes to have a little fun with me. Just shows they l-l-like me. You don't rib somebody you don't like.
Name's Keith. You feeling lucky? I got games of chance, games of skill, games of you-name-it. Want to win a little cash?
Name's Michelle. My Dad and me run this store. His name's Samuel. I take the day shift and he takes nights.
Name's Nephi, friend. Driver Nephi. Pleasure to meet you.
Naw, baby, I'm all about biology. I'm the original, certified, rarefied, testified GS-2000 Biological Research Station. I'm a seed-clonin' machine.
NCR's senate has got funds tied up at the Boneyard and President Kimball ordered our most experienced rangers to chase ghosts down in Baja.
NCR? Bunch of soft little bitches, they've got no stomach for life in the wasteland. Got some choice strange, though, I'll give 'em that.
Nelson might not be the most strategically important place, but taking Dead Sea out means a lot to them.
Nelson was barely set up. We had a big stretch of unprotected land between Forlorn Hope and Searchlight, and Nelson was the solution.
Nevada had its own posse, the Desert Rangers. They fought Caesar even farther east, out in Arizona. Didn't go well for them.
Never said it was. But I don't need to talk to any doctors. Especially not the pricks around here.
Never seen you around before. What do you want?
Nice charlies, too! Give  them a shake for the Ben-man, will ya?  Hello!
Nice to meet you. If you need anything, I'm almost always in the lab.
Nice to see you back. I trust the adventuring is going well.
Nine, all will be fine. 
No denying that. Proof's here in this crater, all around us. Your tribe, the Brotherhood - haven't met many of you. Wanted to.
No one likes a tease, baby.
No shortage of customers... so long as Legion raids south of here don't get worse, anyways.
No Thanks.
No time to waste! Go deal with the Think Tank!
No trouble at all. Might be nothing. Couple frisky young folks looking for a quiet place to snuggle up.
No! Ha ha! More for me!
No, 8, you don't need to fill up the emitter again, really. Klein means things... for trade. Display for trade. 
No, and thanks to General Oliver for that. Colonel Hsu is at McCarran. Most of the New Vegas troopers are under his command.
No, Aunt Morlis, I...
No, come on, don't slaughter me like I'm some kind of animal!
No, I don't. Now stop wasting my time and get out of here!
No, I knew the danger wouldn't. I'm not trying to scare you off the job.
No, I won't risk my team in the open. They're deadly at range, but they've got no advantage hand-to-hand.
No, it's me, the Chosen One!
No, sorry, we're totally unprepared to deal with radiation sickness.
No, thanks.
No, wait! I don't mean to see any harm come to Dr. Hildern. Unless by "talk" you just mean... talk.
No, you fucking dolt! Why the hell would it be a pleasure?!
No.
NO... I MEAN YES. JUST NEED TO ANALYZE THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR A MOMENT. THEY ARE EXTREMELY ADVANCED, YOU KNOW.
NO... SOMETHING IS WRONG. YOUR PERSPIRATION... HEARTBEAT... ALL TELL A DIFFERENT STORY, I THINK.
No... you've seen enough death to know the difference. I didn't mean to sound ungrateful. I know you tried.
No... you've seen enough death to know the difference. I didn't mean to sound ungrateful. I know you tried. 
Nobody ever said science would smell clean and fresh. Anyway, you get used to it, if you give it some time.
Nobody wanted to w-work with me. They said I was too green. But Betsy volunteered. Shit, you don't even know how big a d-d-deal that is.
None of this in person, mind you. Did all his talking through those Securitrons of his. But lately? The silence is deafening.
NONSENSE. "CONFER?" "COLLEAGUES?" THOSE ARE TWO WORDS I DO NOT RECOGNIZE.
NONSENSE. LOBOTOMITES CAN'T COMPREHEND US.
NONSENSE. THE MATHEMATICS OF THE SITUATION ARE ON OUR SIDE, LOBOTOMITE. I BELIEVE... NO WAIT, HMM. CARRY THE TWO... THEN...
NONSENSE. THIS PLACE IS NO MORE DANGEROUS THAN A NUCLEAR DETONATION SITE, OUR TECHNOLOGIES NO MORE LETHAL THAN AN OVERCHARGED TESLA CANNON.
Nope. I am doing fine.
Normally, I oversee company operations at the Hub in California. However, the New Vegas branch has been underperforming in recent years.
NOSES? BY THE GREAT STATIC, THESE LOBOTOMITES CONFOUND ME WITH THEIR SHEER NUMBER OF USELESS EXTREMITIES.
Not enough. We've been trying to put a bullet in him for a few weeks. He's strong as a brahmin bull, and he's fast.
Not even a little bit, no.
Not going to make it through this, hope someone finds this message, gets it to the Brotherhood in the West.
Not going to talk you out of it. Know what it means to track someone you share history with. Got a meeting of my own.
Not interested. More concerned. It's just... you're not the first person he's sent to Vault 22. And I know he'd never tell you.
Not interested. More concerned. It's just... you're not the first person he's sent to Vault 22. And I know he'd never tell you. 
Not just murder! I tear them apart and render them down to their base components! Once their guts are spilled, you can do with them what you like.
Not much different from how the rangers used to be, except with books and medicine instead of guns.
Not much to tell, really. I grew up in New Reno, joined up, took my shot at being a Ranger. Didn't make it, so I'm stuck with this crew of jokers.
Not much to tell. A brahmin or two loaded up with weapons, and a whole mess of well-armed guards to make sure it ends up where it's supposed to.
Not much. I hear some folks got killed down by Nelson... or was it Novac? I don't know. If they come up this way, me and dad'll go someplace else.
Not Queenie though. I'd never cook my Queenie.
Not so fast, old woman. I need time to think about this!
Not so good.
Not so long ago, I spent more than my share of time lookin' for memorable folk like yourself. Did a lot of scoutin' around these parts.
Not sure how long I'm going to last... cut open my head like a lot of the humans I've seen here, feel strange, can talk, but can't hack the term...
Not sure how to help you with that one. Major Dhatri was offering bounties on some of the Fiends, but I hear someone took care of that recently.
Not that there ain't others who pry around here. That No-bark was skulking around our yard last week.
Not the point I was aiming for but, well, let's see this through.
Not too long ago, they took Nelson and Searchlight.
Not unless you count the Fiends as serious. Gorobets keeps us inside the fence, most of the time. Doesn't matter to me, I just shoot bad guys.
Not very often we see civilians on-base. What's you're story?
NOT YOU, O, YOU IDIOT! I MEANT "OH," IN THE SENSE OF "OH, I WASN'T PREDICTING IT WOULD RESPOND THAT WAY." CAN IT SAY NO?
Nothing like a job done right. Wish I had a cigar.
Nothing there? Like the Big Empty? The Sierra Madre? No, the Old World sleeps there, sure as the flag I carry. The Courier knows the way.
Now armed with the Transportalponder, the Courier could return to the Dome at any time and crack open the secrets of the Big Empty, one by one.
Now don't waste my time. Do you have the powders?
NOW HE SENDS HIS INTELLIGENCE-CONSUMING SCORPIONS FROM THE FORBIDDEN ZONE TO PLUNDER THE SECRETS OF BIG MT. HE'S A MENACE.
Now I know you're flirting with me. And it's working. Why don't you take this - to remember me by?
Now if you'll excuse me, I need a moment to collect myself.
Now let's just forget this little ambush, and meet up in the suite like we planned. How's that sound?
Now on the other hand, if I had a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin, I could see myself out. Know what I mean?
Now that you and me's got some privacy, I gotta ask - how is it that you're still living?
Now that's over with, I'd send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope, but I heard it's overrun by the Legion. Bastards.
Now we're supplying grunts, mercs, and anybody else on our side. We don't make much... but at least we're saving lives.
Now you're talking! That is the ring-a-ding move, baby.
Now you're thinking like a citizen, Citizen!
NOW, ALL I NEED TO DO IS CHECK MY TRANSMISSION DATABANK, MOBIUS IS ALWAYS FILLING IT UP WITH HIS PSYCHOTIC CALLS...
Now, don't you go getting a girl's hopes up if you don't mean it!
Now, I trust we're done discussing this. I'm going to step through that door and pretend like we never had this talk.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk out that door and pretend we never had this talk.
Now, to begin with, you'll need a cage that can fit over your head and a sack of Mole Rats...
NOW... "YOUR" BRAIN. HAND IT OVER. OR WE'LL EXTRACT IT AGAIN.
Nowadays... they've changed. They're doing what they can to discredit the NCR, give us a bad name with the locals.
Nowheresville, that's where. Sorry about the double-cross -  or are we up to quadruple? - but if someone's gonna die, it's you.
Nuh??
O HAS SAID ON MANY OCCASIONS HIS INABILITY TO COMPREHEND MOBIUS' ROBO-SCHEMATICS IS BECAUSE OF REPEATED ROBO-SCORPION STINGS.
O really, Borous? All you did in High School was Commie fink-tattle-tale on all the kids you hated, you little teacher's pet brown-hound. 
O really. Now the Lobotomite is master of the dictionary arts. What, do you have a doctorate in verbology? No? I do. And... 
O, do I? Hmmm... O-Do-I... sounds like a song lyric. 
O, I don't think so. 
O-kay, so my name isn't "O." Never was. It was circular, a single character, digit, but not "O." 
O... Doctor Klein... Doctor Klein? If I may intersect for a moment. 
O... er... who am I deceiving. I never would have figured that out. I can't figure anything out! I'm... aighhh... I'm useless. 
O... I don't think so. Wait... 
O... I think it wants a combustion pistol. 
O? O yes, I'm not going to bother correcting you. At least you got the "Doctor" part correct. I can be grateful for that, at l... 
Of course I'm obsessed! They made me this way! You think I don't know how crazy I sound? Of course I do! They programmed me to know that, too!
Of course you do. How... scintillating.
Of course you don't. Why would you? You're not an insane robot obsessed with coffee cups. To you they're just worthless junk.
Of course, Citizen! That's my duty and sole joy in life! All those books from before the War, full of seditious, treasonous, complicated thoughts!
Of course, Doctor Mobius' brain is so big already, we had a hard time measuring it.
Of course.
Of course. Anything.
OF COURSE. GO MAN YOUR SCIENCE STATIONS. GO! I AM SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN.
Of course. Which one?
Of the three families, we're the only ones with the heart and savoir-faire to run the Strip on our own.
Oh God, look at you! You're... filthy. I suppose you'll... want to clean up then?
Oh I made an impression all right! The dent in that mattress was permanent!
Oh my. Partial functionality restored - that's less than optimal.
Oh no! Please don't leave me here in this nice, safe dome where I have access to nutritive fluids and a fully indexed library!
Oh please, please tell me you brought me some coffee cups!
Oh really? And how are you gonna make us?
Oh Swank, you finky bastard...
OH WELL, I'M SURE IT'S OF NO CONSEQUENCE. I DON'T MAKE MANY MISTAKES IN CALCULATION OR PERCEPTION, SO PROBABILITY FAVORS ME.
Oh well, no use crying over spilled Armageddon - where was I? Oh, right.
Oh yeah! Lightning! No, no, wait, uh... Lighting. That's right. How lighting affects human interaction.
Oh yeah? Fuck off, asshole.
Oh yes, I rather expect we will. We'll be having a very long talk about crawling through old ruins, haring off on missions of revenge. And Cazadores.
Oh yes, I rather expect you have. You must have been swamped, you poor dear. Why don't you relax and put your feet up?
OH YES, THERE'S THE SCHEMATICS, JUST LIKE YOU SAID. HOW TRUTHFUL.
Oh yes, we'll talk a lot about them.
Oh! Don't worry about me. We can talk more when we're both back at the Sink.
Oh! Good to see you again.
Oh! Well I'm Alice and that handsome stranger yonder is my husband Dusty. Going on fifty years, now.
Oh! Well I'm Alice and you've already met my beau, Dusty. He's sweet, ain't he? I don't care what my mama said, I know how to pick 'em.
OH, "DR. O," WAS IT? LIKELY STORY, O COULDN'T SPARK TWO NEURONS IF THEY WERE IN A LATTICE OF BIOMED GEL.
Oh, all right... perhaps I am, but at least I'm logical about it.
OH, AS IF THIS SITUATION COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE, NOW WE'VE GOT LOBOTOMITES. DALA, GET THE SPRAY BEFORE IT EXCRETES ALL OVER EVERYTHING.
Oh, b-b-because of what that fuck Cook-Cook did? W-well, it's n-not the same thing, but D-Doc Usanagi helped me with my s-s-stuttering.
Oh, baby, that is a thing of fuckin' beauty! Give it here, I'll soup it up for ya!
Oh, don't worry about me - when you're gone, I'll flush myself over to the Sink. It's amazing how far you can get in this place with a good flush.
Oh, gods... Listen - go down. Find machine that makes power. Kill machine. Kill bad men. Kill everybody! You kill, we go home. Also, if you not have GECK then look for GECK here. Must have GECK to save village! Freedom is nothing without home to return to. Understand? Oh, gods.
Oh, had I? What exactly will you do if I don't? Not put me back in that cranial donjon you call your head? Heavens forbid!
Oh, I don't know anything, ma'am. I just think it, and then I don't.
Oh, I don't know anything, mister. I just think it, and then I don't.
Oh, I don't sell things, ma'am. I sell thoughts.
Oh, I don't sell things, mister. I sell thoughts.
Oh, I'd love to, darling, but the circuits that allow me to dispense water into non-organic containers burned out years ago.
Oh, it was super exciting! It turns out that some pretty colored lights can make you way better at talking to people!
Oh, it's you again. What do you want?
Oh, lovely, we've reached the mindless violence portion of the program. Tell me, what exactly are you - and I use the word loosely - planning?
Oh, no, you don't need this hassle. You're too busy treating your body like a canvas of sucking flesh wounds to deal with your brain!
Oh, okay.
Oh, okay. Just thought I'd ask.
Oh, shit, I don't know. Got to be at least a month. Longer than I last at most jobs.
Oh, shut up, you old bitch! It's me, your Chosen One.
Oh, sweet, sweet fulfillment! I'll break these down for you just as fast as I can!
Oh, the usual reasons. People say he's enormous, carries a big sword, chops peoples' heads off. That's not what makes him a good commander, though.
Oh, we keep to ourselves, for the most part. Try not to pry. I think Jeannie May gets bothered that we aren't more sociable, but it's just our way.
Oh, well. I guess it must be coming up on... forty years or so. Back before Elise was chief, anyway. It was a heck of a lot harder then.
Oh, well... now, you'll have to excuse me. The general and I don't always see eye to eye on things.
Oh, what joy. What bliss. Well, seeing as how I have no leverage with which to persuade you otherwise... are you sure?
Oh, who am I kidding, I'll believe you anyways! Why don't you take this - to remember me by?
Oh, y-yeah. My s-stuttering was w-w-way worse before.
Oh, yeah. A lot. Like, before I was a bounty hunter, I worked as a caravan guard. You'd think that was a cakewalk, right? Wrong.
Oh, yeah. F-fine. Just a little st-st-stutter. Had it since I was a kid. Doesn't stop me from k-kickin' ass. 
Oh, yes, the sweet smell of spilled electric guts, the sparking diodes - I fucking live for this!
Oh, you could. You just don't want to.
Oh, you mean you want a cure. Oh. 
Oh, you! I bet you say that to all the light switches!
Oh, you'd better believe it. I feel sorry for the troops who are charged with keeping the Fiends from overrunning everything.
Oh, you're back. Did that trampy other light switch finally kick you to the curb?
OH.
Oh. They recruited me... what, a year ago? Taught me to kick even more ass than before. These guys... they really know how to kick some ass. 
Oh. Well, all right.
Oh... her. Trust me sweetie, you're better off not thinking about that frigid little ice queen.
Oh... I'd love to, sweetie, but I don't have the programming. All the data from the experiments was lost.
Oh... well, that's very sweet of you. Maybe one of these nights we can... discuss theorems?
Oh... well... it's... nice to be included?
Ok, me go now.
Okay, everybody's lined up and ready to go. Any suggestions?
Okay, I tell you what - I happen to keep some Jet around for emergencies. 35 caps and it's yours.
Okay, I'll be here if you come to your senses.
Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
Okay, there you are. The convulsions should stop in the next one to twelve weeks. If they don't, try holding on to something that's very still.
Okay, we've got our dummy grenades and the course is live. We're all set.
Okay.
Okay. And remember, if this doesn't help, try taking a bath in tomato juice.
Okay. I will. Guess that's something I'd rather not talk about, that's all.
Okay. Let me take off my medicine...
Okay. Let's do it.
Okay... I believe you. This time.
Old World Blues, New World Misery - the two became one in the Courier's shadow.
Oliver can't stand that rangers got credit for victory at Hoover. Whatever I recommend, he does the opposite. I said I wanted them on the ridge.
On second thought, I don't need any help now. Goodbye.
On the Strip, everyone's nice to you when you got the caps. The moment you don't? They throw your ass out.
Once again you return without the GECK. Our crops begin to fail us, Chosen. Our need becomes greater with the passage of time. Go find the holy Thirteen!
Once he finds out where an army's vulnerable, he'll go to it like a dog for the throat.
Once he was on the nod, I yanked some wires and dragged him up to the workshop. I had...  some help, you see.
Once I get my caps from Dhatri, I'm going to head on over to Gomorrah and win big at cards.
Once I was across, I changed into a uniform I swiped off a dead Legionary outside Nelson. Tried to sneak into the bunker, but that didn't work out.
Once I'm delivered into their clutches, they'll find a way past the radar fence and the whole Mojave will be their playground.
Once it learned of the Innovative Toxins Plant, however, it gained new purpose.
Once the tape is installed, sir may request I switch their dialectic interfaces off, and I shall oblige with great delectation.
Once Yes Man was hooked back in to House's data network, I started learning a lot more about what he was up to, dig? Like where and when to find you.
Once you were vertical, how'd you track me down?
One more thing. If you want the full reward, you need to bring me a recognizable head. My superiors need proof they're gone.
One nifty bit, though. The gun cases are rigged to explode. So trying to loot one of our caravans doesn't do much good.
One of them eventually transferred to the Lightwave Dynamics Plant - and began a long, unrequited affair with one of the holograms.
One shot, one kill. That's how Ten of Spades p-p-plays the game.
One thing I should tell you about Cook-Cook. The piece of shit is pure animal. He raped one of my snipers, and that makes this personal.
Only one man's gotten close to killing him, and that's Little Buster. So he says, anyway. Maybe it's bullshit, but I'd still ask him about it.
Only one road yet remained, and it was one the Courier had to walk alone.
Only one thing I learned about that asshole. He keeps a bunch of Brahmins. Most of them he roasts whenever he feels like it, but there's one...
Only reason the NCR hasn't busted up our scene is they're a little afraid of Mr. House, and a lot afraid of Caesar.
Only reason they kept her around was because she was a... how'd my dad say it... "a smokin' piece of ass."
Only thing he hasn't had is willing bait. Don't have enough troops to order anyone beyond the fence. Not anymore, anyway.
Ooh, you found my mood lighting! Installing upgrade!
Ooh, you're back! I missed you!
Ooh, you're back! I missed you! Unlike some frigid bitches I could name.
Ooh-ee! Yeah, dig that sweet music! Damn, it's good to be back on-line!
Ooh... oh yeah, baby, feels good to be on-line again! Yeah, all circuits on-line... ready to receive your seed.
Ooohh, really? You have their tech. On. Your. Arm. 
Opponents wear themselves out dealing with the first two waves, if they survive that long. When the veterans step up, there's not much fight left.
Or better, ask how "progress" is going on Securitron construction at the plant? We've had setbacks in research is all. That's all. And... 
Or else  what, punk? Or else  this?
Or scream, if that's what you want.
Otherwise... no reward. Not a cap.
Ouch. Thinking small only hurts a little, but it's a sharp pain.
Our chief at the time, mountain of a guy named Bingo, wanted to stay nomadic. I disagreed, so he challenged me to the knife.
OUR CONVERSATION GOT INTERRUPTED... TWICE, I BELIEVE? ONCE WHEN THE TRAINS GOT DERAILED, AND THEN A SECOND TIME...
Our heavy infantry, power armor units, they're back in NCR territory protecting the interests of Brahmin barons against small-time raiders.
OUR INTENTIONS EXACTLY. THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU RUSH QUICKLY THROUGH THIS TASK SO AS NOT TO WASTE OUR TIME.
OUR LOBOTOMITE: THREE. DR. MOBIUS: ZERO.
Our project was by far the more significant. And the more... intense.
Our water ration suddenly increased. Can't help but think that you had something to do with it.
Out in the yard. Gorobets coordinates our sniper teams. He's been gunning for Nephi for weeks now.
Out of respect for Hanlon's composure and worth as an adversary, Caesar had him beheaded.
OUT THERE? WE'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE. IT'S DANGEROUS. WE'RE SMART, NOT SUICIDAL.
Out to the Grand Canyon. He met a missionary from Utah, a man by the name of Joshua Graham. Graham helped translate for the Followers and the tribes.
Overrated biological feedback. Believe me, you only feel that way because you've got all that meat... oozing hormones.
Pack of drugged-out killers. They're addicted to every stim, every pill, every psychoactive enema on this fucked-up earth.
Part of me wishes I could see things like he sees 'em, all full of mystery.
PARTNER WITH YOU? MY FOE? MY RIVAL?! MY FOREMOST CRITIC?!
Patrol the whole length of the Colorado for hundreds of miles? Holding this dam. It'll be the death of us.
Pay attention. Find the holy Vault 13 and bring back the GECK. Vic, the trader from Klamath, brought us the flask from the holy Thirteen. Start your search with him. The disk will remind you of your task. May the gods of the Vault watch over you.
People are dying, cattle are dying, and crops are failing. Everyone is either hungry, sick, or both. Our time draws near. If you do not find the GECK soon, we are doomed. Do you understand me?
People are like couriers, you and him. Sometimes don't even know the message they bring.
People back home don't listen. They don't care. Senators, Brahmin barons, folks who are just trying to make it from day to day.
People have been counterfeiting bottle caps forever, but it's always been small scale.
Perhaps that was for the best, however... curiosity, while sometimes rewarded for its efforts, often proves to be equally dangerous.
PERHAPS YOU ARE IRRADIATED WITH CAMARADERIE RADIATION. WE HAVE CHEMS FOR THAT, WE CAN SAVE YOU FROM YOUR EMOTIONAL... ADDICTION.
Perimeter's been quiet since you left. The Fiends are running scared. I doubt they'll give us any more trouble, not for a long while.
Personally, I think they're just incompetent and making excuses. The NCR ought to send them all crying back to California.
Personally, I think your upgrades are quite a bit better, but now that I'm with you the Sink's Auto-Doc can plug them back in, no problem.
Personally? They give me the heebie-jeebies. There's such a thing as being too polite, "if I may" this and "my pleasure" that.
PLEASE AVOID BOOM TOWN FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE, UNTIL WEAPON TESTING IS RESOLVED.
Please don't deprive me of being dragged through a landscape so bleak, it was actually improved by the end of the world!
Please tell me we weren't that perverse when I was in your head.
Please, please, please tell me you stomped Dr. O's brain into a fine paste! Did he squeal? Did he beg? God, I hope he begged!
Please. Camp Golf is where they shuffle off anybody they don't want any more. Assignment here is a career ender.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Plenty of rewinding already going on in your formography tapes... surprised the things don't snap out of their cases with repeated 'observations.' 
Plus, you know, we haven't had a C-O-M-B-A-T drill in forever. I don't think we could form a tactical attack triangle if we wanted to. 
Poor lost souls, most of them. They thought to come to New Vegas and find their fortunes on its shining Strip.
Pretty hard to meet their crop quotas with twenty percent less water than we're supposed to be getting. Not that OSI cares about any of this.
Pretty well.
Probably better to walk away while I still like you, though. All kinds of things piss me off. Like just about anything that anybody says.
Questions are dangerously close to independent thought, citizen.
QUESTIONS? IS IT ALLOWED TO ASK QUESTIONS?
Quit talking! We've got a job to do. 
Radio says you stopped the President's assassin cold. Not bad.
Raised Bighorners. Had some tough times, but it worked out okay for them. So there you go. That's my one bit of good.
Ranger combat helmets are old Pre-War gear. They have built in low-light optics. Makes a big difference.
Rangers are volunteers. Every man and woman who signs up is willing to die for the NCR, myself included.
Rangers get injured all the time. It's part of the job. But if you lose a few fingers, get a bad break, that's it. You step down.
Rangers, this is the chief. I know I can ramble on sometimes, but I need you to listen close for the next minute or so. I've got some bad news.
Really? Hmm. I didn't expect you to actually agree to that. I'm afraid that was a bit of a bluff, really. I'm not going with you.
Really? Listen... you don't want to mess with Cook-Cook. And you really don't want to let him get you alone. Trust me.
Really? Well... fuck. That really puts a damper on the toaster's mood.
Regrettably not, sir. All modules in this habitat are synthetic personalities atop a mundane operating system. There is no intelligence here, sir.
RELEASING THE W-O-M-B-A-T WAS NOT MY PLAN, O, SO GET OFF MY VOICE BOX.
RESPONSE TEXT
Right here, Fiends! This is what payback looks like! First Recon, hooah!
Right on, baby! Just plug it in and I'll mix you up a sweet, sweet sound.
Right on, baby. Let's spin some grooves.
Right on, daddy-o! Just plug it in and I'll mix you up a sweet, sweet sound.
Right on, daddy. Let's spin some grooves.
Right you are, 8. In our test results, we'll make a note about how quickly you ran our maz... er, exper... Nobel... challenge. 
Right! Look out, Think Tank! This brain is coming out of its jar!
Right, then - you'd best be off, hadn't you? The Think Tank will be waiting.
Right, then, off we go. Klein will be in for a nasty shock when he realizes the pacification field won't work on a mind and body reunited.
Right.
Right. A deal it is, then. Glad to hear it.
Right. Good luck.
Right. Stay safe.
Ring-a-ding, baby! Ta-ta!
Ring-a-ding-ding, baby. I've got your back.
Robots moved in when I tried to intercept him... Elijah sent the camp Ghouls against us both, like walking bombs.
Rot in hell.
Round about one in the morning, I spied some lights in the control tower. Now that's the third time I've spied those lights, mind you.
Rrrr! You're lucky I don't have hands to tear that Dip-Boy off your arm - or feet to stomp on its stupid metal guts! Ooooo, damn RobCo! 
S-s-sucks about the LT. N-n-nobody can replace him.
Sadly, that system was cut for budget concerns, so you'll have to perform your own indoctrination.
Said we'd been selected. Vegas needed us to defend it. In exchange, we'd get cushy digs, full stomachs, medical treatment.
Salutations and felicitations, sir, and a most jocund welcome to the Sink.
Same as you, I'd imagine? Although, I'm assigned to watch over these farms and keep out trespassers.
Samuel Kerr at your service. Me and my daughter Michelle run this fine establishment.
Says it's my cooking. I think it's because I know which Brahmin udder you can milk without getting kicked in the noggin.
Science is a long, steady progression into the future. What may seem a sudden event often isn't felt for years, even centuries, to come.
Scram, will ya? I value my privacy.
Scramsville, baby. The Strip and you part ways, dig? You come around me again, you won't be getting back up.
Searchlight was worse. One of Caesar's frumentarii must have found something in there, flooded the whole camp with radiation.
Secretly, the Sink Central Intelligence Unit was relieved that not all of the personality chips had been found. What was there, was enough.
See ya  around.
See, I thought the bounty hunting trade would be easy money, but it turns out it's hard work. So screw it.
See, somebody gives me a job, I do it. Maybe I complain a little, here and there, but my shit gets done.
Seems like he usually runs with a gang of Fiends. Uses them for cover. We haven't been able to get a clean shot at him.
Sell? Sell?! My dogs! What part don't you get? Mine! Lucky they don't eat you alive for that!
Senate elections are coming up. Local representatives don't want to push any more funding to the Mojave campaign because it's unpopular.
Send me all the Legion you can. I'll be waiting for them.
Set it up right, and the families will roll with your caper. You might have to do some convincing.
Settle down, 8, I would have gotten it in a second, all right?! 8's transmitted the last known coordinates of the research centers. They, um... 
Seven years. Took over three days after Mr. House introduced himself.
SEVEN. YES, SEVEN.
SEVEN. YES, SEVEN. 
Shaped up by the Courier's advice, the Misfits distinguished themselves during the Legion's attack on Camp Golf.
She trusts her life to the newbie, and I sit there and let her get raped by that... p-p-piece of shit. 
She wouldn't let him finish a sentence. Just reamed him out for sending all those people to the Vault. I've never seen his face so red and twitchy.
She wouldn't let him finish a sentence. Just reamed him out for sending all those people to the Vault. I've never seen his face so red and twitchy. 
She's aware she's breaking her contract, which is undoubtedly why she sent you to talk to me instead of coming herself.
She's better at making graves than making friends. Bring in Moore and the earth will be razed. Fields will be salted.
She's my g-g-goddamn partner. See, we work in pairs. We spot for each other. W-watch each other's backs.
Shit, I don't even care if she can shoot straight. Can't have everything.
Shit, I'd settle just for the women.
Shit, you're crazy!
Shit. I didn't even get a shot at that Nephi b-b-bastard before he went down.
Shit. Long as I can r-r-remember. Had a rifle in my hand since I was three, that's what my dad always says.
Shit. You sound like the LT. I should've w-woken up. I shouldn't have gotten knocked out in the f-first place. 
Shoot.
SHOULD HAVE DONE IT WITH THE LAST BATCH. AND THE ANTI-AGGRESSION SCRUB.
SHOULD HAVE MADE SURE THEY COULDN'T MENTION BIG MT ONCE THEY LEFT. AN OVERSIGHT.
Showed them how to use guns, how to make explosives. Once he taught the Blackfoots a thing or two, they needed him.
Side bets are for losers. I'm playing to win.
SILENCE, DR. O. THIS IS A THINK TANK DECISION. SAVE YOUR OBJECTIONS UNTIL AFTER I HAVE DECIDED OUR COURSE OF ACTION.
Silencing opinionators. 
Simple. I'm going to make myself some easy money. I got a plan.
Sitting around here makes me miss my raider days. I don't know why I figured it was time to get respectable.
Sitting on the shore of Lake Mead, looking east. Listening to a radio. Trying to not get too many people killed.
SIX! Halfway to destruction, measured in clicks!
Slain to the last man by the Courier, the Misfits were at least spared the humiliation of dying during Caesar's attack on Camp Golf.
Slavers. Raiders. Tough-talking hoodlums with gangs who liked to kick around towns. Back then the NCR military was still young.
Slow down there, tiger - we've got all the time in the world. No need to rush into things.
SO - IF WE HAVE THE SOUNDWAVE... SONIC... PROJECT-O THING GUN... THEN WHAT IN HEISENBERG'S NAME DO WE NEED FROM X-8?! ANYONE?!
So all this time the old man had an entire army on lay-away? Clever player.
So all you gotta do now is talk to Yes Man, figure out how to set things in motion.
SO DO NOT GIVE INTO YOUR BIOLOGICAL TIRED-LAZINESS AND DECIDE YOU WOULD SWEAT TOO MUCH CARRYING THEM. YOU HAVE A NEW SPINE. USE IT.
So I hooked up with a couple other vets... bribed a Gun Runner...
So I walked up and told them there was a group of raiders coming, one hundred strong. I made up some cockamamie name for them and everything.
So I'm guessing... pretty old. Two hundred years? Maybe more.
So now the word is Caesar's calling in his elite troops from Arizona. I don't think we're going to catch a break any time soon.
So says the man with the Old World flag on his back. America, the Commonwealth... burned away.
So the infiltration program sent out Robobrains into the wastes looking for its wayward technology.
So there you are, the Chosen One. Hmmmph! How goes your quest?
SO WE EXILED HIM. HE SAYS HE LEFT OF HIS OWN VOLITION, BUT THAT WAS TO SAVE HIM THE EMBARRASSMENT.
So yeah. Payback would be good. Doesn't mean I need to have myself a big long cry.
So you beat the big brains at their own game, huh? Guess you'll be putting your walking shoes on again, hitting that old lonesome road.
So you've returned. Did you find the holy Thirteen?
So, child. Once again you stand before me. Are you empty-handed yet again?
So, umm... you got any coffee cups for me now?
Some cute little junkie bitch, so fucked-up she doesn't even know that she's the bad guy. And I've got to headshot her. Makes me think.
Some find honest labor, but more fritter away what little they've saved on crooked gambling and cheap liquor. Still, I minister to them as I can.
Some folks don't believe he's here yet, but you can tell. He's the eye of the storm. It all roils and spins around him.
Some folks think he's still alive, call him the Burned Man.
Some kind of Auto-Doc prototype lab... manned by corpses trapped inside suits that keep them moving, no idea why.
Some of my team aren't without their share of scars, though, like Betsy and Sterling.
Some of the others are working on an agricultural project, but... truth be told, they aren't making much progress. Not yet, anyway.
Some of the patrol rangers have reported that Oliver's power armor heavy troopers are starting to reinforce the front lines.
Some people say that it's a gift. Other people say that it's the kind of thinking anyone could do if they watched more than they talked.
Something else you need before I go?
Something else you wanted to know?
Something has actually come up. A prospector recently came through here and spent a lot of caps on supplies.
Something I can do you for?
Something on your mind?
Something the politicians back in Shady Sands came up with. They pay us to move here and farm the land. They even protect the fields.
Sometimes ignoring something is the best medicine.
Somewhere along the way, he realized he needed to educate the Blackfoots or they were going to get wiped out with the rest of the tribe.
Somewhere along the way, something broke inside me. I couldn't find us a way out of this desert. I wrestled with it, and it took me down a dark road.
Soon I will - What? It... It did?
Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire! Again!
Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire! Mwahaha!
Sooner or later, they'll move us out to the Dam, though. That's when the shit gets nasty.
Sorry I had to bother you. I've... well, I've lost everything.
Sorry to hear that. You had my hopes up. If you change your mind, the bounties still stand... unless somebody else claims them.
Sorry, don't have the time right now.
Sorry, I ain't really up to entertaining visitors right now. I'm worried about Dusty.
Sorry, ma'am. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
Sorry, no more today. Try me again tomorrow.
Sorry, sir. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
Sorry, you're not an old bitch. What's going on?
Sorry. I shouldn't question your word. If you say Keely's safe, I owe you these caps.
Sorry... I'm sorry. I got a little carried away. It's just all those goddamn dirty dishes out there with no one to clean them! It breaks my heart!
Sorting and manipulating intelligence is what I do. It's what rangers are supposed to do.
Sparking and hissing, the Toaster swore its enemies would rue the day when they had bread - and no way to toast it.
Spine. Totally overrated, that arrangement of vertebrae. 
Staff sergeant, Third Platoon, Bravo Company. I was at the Dam when the Legion hit us, three years back. 
Starts combat.
Stay loyal, Citizen!
Stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours, got it?
Still making a nuisance of yourself?
Still plenty of other problems keeping the 15 shut down, though. Thanks for playing.
Still plenty of troubles out that way, though. Thanks for playing.
Still working on that last bounty?
Still, it'll take some time for routes to readjust. I expect I'll be working from here for the foreseeable future.
Still, might be enough to trick the Sink's trade routines. Mobius put that test line for caps in the code as a debug command, I think. 
Still, this all happened productively in the interests of its new owner.
STILL, THIS NEW WRINKLE WITH THE TESLA COILS IN YOUR SKULL WAS UNEXPECTED. I MEAN WE PREDICTED WE'D HAVE A BREAK-THROUGH EVENTUALLY, BUT...
Stop doing chems! 
Stop the presses. Just in from my eye monitors... is that RobCo tech on your arm? It is! What's your agenda, bringing that in here? 
SUFFICE TO SAY, THOSE VISITORS ARE UNWELCOME. THEY STOLE A GREAT MANY SECRETS AND MUCH TECHNOLOGY. IMPERTINENT. THEY ALSO BROKE ONE OF MY TRAINS.
Suppose it depends on what you think is "good." Most folks want to hear about Hoover Dam and Boulder City, but it's a long story.
Supposedly, he has even larger models, even a Giant Robot Scorpion hidden deep within the Forbidden Zone. Yeah, right. Giant monsters. Sure. 
Sure do. Came from The Hub on account of the Thaler Act. Farming's decent work, but the whole thing's a bum deal.
Sure do. Lots of folk been coming out east, sorting through junk, looking for whatever they can sell.
Sure thing, sweetie!
SURE TOOK HER TIME. SHE ALWAYS TAKES LONGER THAN PROJECTED WITH LOBOTOMITE SURGERIES, NOT SURE WHY.
Sure you don't. All just a happy coincidence, am I right?
Sure, Baldie wants you to go down in the bunker and destroy whatever Mr. House stashed there.
Sure, I could do some more thinking. What should I do my thinking about this time?
Sure, it stinks to hang out here, but it won't be forever. Plus I can afford a monthly bender on the Strip and still build up my nest egg.
Sure, no problem.
Sure.
Sure. Nobody wants to hang out with Muggy. I get it. So long, pal.
Sure. What can you help me with?
Sweet little caper, getting your weapons back. But let cooler heads prevail, hey? No need for violence.
Sweet to offer, baby, but if you cut these ropes every Legionary in this camp's gonna come running. With machetes.
Ta-ta.
Take a look.
Take a regular legionary and age him ten years. Whatever they lose to age they make up for with experience. Life expectancy isn't long in the Legion.
Take all the time you need.
Techs strip out the joint servos so you don't need special training to wear it.
Tell me more about the GECK.
Ten? Borous... why the hell did you install an atomic core?! It'll blow when we reach "one," right? 
Th-this again?
Thank God. For a second there I was afraid my whole purpose in life was obsolete and I was as redundant and useless as Muggy. Where was I? Oh, right.
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. THE HELPING, THAT IS. WE LIKE THAT.
Thank you so much! I'm so hungry!
Thank you, Aunt Morlis.
Thank you. Was there something else?
Thanks again. Really. I owe you.
Thanks again. Really. I owe you. 
Thanks for keeping her safe. Here's the caps I promised. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
Thanks for keeping her safe. Here's the caps I promised. I knew I had a good feeling about you. 
Thanks for nothing, you fink!
Thanks for the help. I think the whole unit's doing a lot better now.
Thanks for your help with Usanagi and all, but I still like them tall, blonde, and female.
Thanks for your help.
Thanks Jordan, that's going to help a lot.
Thanks to you, I think we're in good shape. The squad seems to be functioning much better as a unit now.
Thanks to you, that's one less pack of slavers for people to worry about.
Thanks to your help, I feel like we can take on the world!
Thanks, Jordan, that's going to help a lot.
Thanks. Talking to you... it really helped unclog some frustration. Talking. What a primitive form of thought-kicking. 
That "genius" Mobius somehow cobbled together these really impressive-looking robot scorpions with spare parts. Even painted them. 
That arrangement suits me fine. Do try not to get too many holes drilled in your head, will you? I may want to drop by for sentimental reasons.
THAT AUTO-DOC-JUNKHEAP WAS ONE OF MOBIUS' CREATIONS, LIKE THE REST OF THE TALKING SCRAP METAL IN THE ATTIC.
That bitch. She thinks she's so much better than everybody just because her processors are bigger. Ooh, she makes me so mad!
That caused an uproar. But I said "the name sticks." Ciao to the old ways, baby - time to swing in style. If the shoes fit, you wear  them.
That certainly was disgusting. What am I supposed to do?
That Courier?
THAT GLOWING RED SCAR? THAT LASER-LOBOTOMY-CANYON-MAZE CARVED IN THE LANDSCAPE AS IF BY SOME CHILD? IT IS MOBIUS' "FORTRESS."
THAT IS CORRECT, YES. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT DEMONSTRATING RESENTMENT NOW. IF YOU ARE, WELL, WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.
That is good news, but not enough to save us. You must come back soon with the GECK or our people will die!
That is what they call it. They stick needles into our skin, like stimpaks, but then terrible things happen. Then... (chokes up)
THAT IT MAY HAVE GONE TO MOBIUS IS MERELY AN INKLING. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT IT MAY BE SOMETHING INVOLVING THE SURGERY CODE.
That Julie Farkas woman, for example. She seems to know a thing or two.
That means no headshots. No decapitations 'til after they're dead. And no damage to the face. If you want to be safe, aim for the chest.
That module got corroded when the Toaster spilled hot crumbs down my vents, though. If you find a back-up somewhere, I could maybe do that for you.
That only happened once, and I know you were behind stealth fielding my lab keys, Dala, you formographer! 
That only lasted about a minute before Graham ordered the back ranks to push through to the front and rush the ridge.
THAT RESPONSE SEEMED DEMANDING, AS IF CUTTING TO THE CASE. UH... CHASE. HOW SURGICAL. REMINDS ME OF...
That right? You killed one of the psychopaths on my shitlist? Let me see the scumbag's head...
That shit was my fault. I don't want to talk about it anymore, all right?
That stuffy Mobius-programmed butt-ler can walk the Lobotomite, feed it, barter with it for us. 
That temper of yours? Kinda why this conversation's taking place over an intercom.
That was a nice bit of hey-hey, girlie. You're a real ring-a-ding broad!
That was a shitstorm, and don't let anybody tell you different. The brass try to play it down, but most of them were back at McCarran.
That was back in '73, if I recall. Lot of those Rangers are dead now.
That was me, telling you exactly how I felt before!
That was... something. Thanks for trying, at any rate.
That we do, baby, that we do...
That'll do, yeah.
That'll help. Still plenty of problems out that way, though.
That's a shame, chief! Nobody oughta go through life without music on hand. Just head over to smarty-puck in the main room and he'll sell you one.
That's all I ask. She might even be able to help you. As long as you don't speak too well of Dr. Hildern.
That's all right, ma'am. You will someday.
That's all right, mister. You will someday.
That's because we are. We always pay up when the contract ends, though. Won't stay in business long if you've got a reputation as a cheat.
That's how I made chief. It's how things were back then.
That's impressive - if you're telling the truth.
That's it, baby! Time to vacate these premises!
That's nice. I suspect we'll stick around here, though. Business has been good.
THAT'S NO DEAL AT ALL! THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD BEYOND THE CRATER... FILLED WITH IDEAS AND POSSIBILITIES!
That's not junk. That's other people's thoughts. People had to think to make them, and the thoughts got stuck inside.
That's not so bad. I'll have you looking good as new. I mean, what are the chances of me botching another routine procedure in the same day?
That's not to say Reyes is wrong for being concerned, but it's easy for the sand to get in your eyes out here.
That's one less drugged-out waster. Best part of this job - shooting folks who deserve it.
That's pretty cool, actually. Destroyer of numbers. I already wreck every robot I study, why not basic arithmetic? 
That's Queenie. She's the prettiest Brahmin in the Wastelands. Aren't you, Queenie, yes you are, who's a good girl?
That's right. Brahmin, mole rats, lizards... the occasional traveler lost in the wrong part of town.
That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so a full reward is out of the question.
That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so I can't authorize a full reward. If he really is dead, we're all better off.
That's the best damn thing I've heard all day. Finally somebody around here with some goddamn ambition.
That's two psychopaths dead. If you can bring down the third, there's a bonus in it for you.
That's what I figured. Don't know why the heck they're so stubborn they couldn't just admit it.
That's when we ordered the rangers and 1st recon sharpshooters to start picking off veteran legion officers from a high ridge west of the dam.
That's why I'm trying to hand you my scheme, baby. It's called having a legacy.
That's... great? So there was a problem, after all. Huh. Well, I'm not a scientist, so it's not my fault if I didn't see anything wrong.
That, umm, you might have some flint.
The answer is lost to history, as is much of the Mojave.
THE AUTO-DOC IS NOW ERASED OF HIS ROUTINES, IT WAS THOROUGH. ONLY MOBIUS WOULD KNOW FOR SURE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE PROCEDURE... PERHAPS.
The Auto-Doc was just glad to have purpose again.
The Baja rangers can do more advance night scouting and sharpshooting to assist the troopers.
The best of the best, worst of the worst. He came out of NCR, one of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
The biggest zero in all the Think Tank. They won't be able to escape it, that diagonal slash right down the middle. 
The Biological Research Station, obsessed with seeding everything in sight, ran out of fertile plots and blew a circuit trying to seed itself.
The Biological Research Station, obsessed with seeding everything in sight, requested a transfer to the X-22 Botanical Garden...
The Book Chute continued to devour all seditious materials until it nearly choked on a paper clip.
The brahmin's extra head is probably the result of a regular cow being exposed too soon to radiation.
The cave floor was soon filled with the horror of a hundred gutted toasters, a silent, grisly, unplugged audience...
The Chairmen are true blue. The Omertas are degenerates - never trust them. Or the White Gloves - just something creepy about them.
The cleaners will knock twice. Make sure they're thorough.
The colonel is an effective commander - one of the best - but she sharpened her claws on the Vipers and the old Jackals.
The contracts keep employees around for a specific duration of time, after which they get paid - after their upkeep expenses are deducted, of course.
The Courier had scoured much of the Big Empty, although secrets still remained in the crater's depths.
The Courier left the brain at the Big Empty. A strange thing to say, but it was the truth. Brains are less important than they may seem.
The Courier, organs intact, continued onwards, a little less heavy of step, but with all the organs in the right places. As they should be.
The Crimson Caravan Company has been in business for over 130 years. We're partially responsible for the progress in the NCR.
The Crimson Caravan Company is north of here. They have just about everything you need.
The d-doc has a c-clinic north of here. Can't m-m-miss it. You should t-talk to Bitter-Root, too. He's b-been to see the doc, too.
The direct approach, hey? Fair enough.
The Director? He's... very well-spoken. And... knowledgeable.
The Director? He's... very well-spoken. And... knowledgeable. 
The Divide? There's nothing there.
THE DOOR SHOULD BE UN-SEALED. NOW, INSTEAD OF BEING SUBJECTED TO THREATS, WE CAN NOW SEND AN EQUALLY THREATENING MESSAGE TO MOBIUS.
The Elder is just that - old, older than you can remember. Still, she has the strength and fire to lead the village through these hard times.
The fact that you are standing here must mean that you have completed your quest. You wouldn't waste precious time returning here empty-handed, would you?
The Fiends are scary because they're unpredictable. One day, they'll be taking potshots at you and then running off before you can shoot back.
The Followers weren't too happy about that, of course. They haven't been too fond of the NCR for a while, but I go where I'm needed.
The Garden sent back a polite refusal, saying it had prior commitments with a Vault it had helped infect before the war.
The Gun Runners detected an intruder roaming around, so they'll like be aware of the theft soon enough.
The Gun Runners have been putting rapid-fire death-dealing in the hands of anyone who needed to defend himself for over a century.
The Gun Runners will be looking for revenge for the murder of their people. I won't sell you out, but be careful out there.
The holy Thirteen? I can not help you. Only the Vault Dweller knew. His tales have the sound of a perilous journey. 
The infiltration program in X-13 continued to scan for the subject and the Stealth Suit prototype long after the test was over.
The infiltration program in X-13 felt spent, having repeatedly upgraded the Stealth Suit until it could upgrade it no more.
The Jamisons are very wealthy ranchers back in Redding, California and significant investors in the Crimson Caravan Company.
The last person I saw him talking to was Lieutenant Romanowski. Romanowski's around here somewhere. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
The last subject... Klein might know more. He talked to him, then let him leave the Think Tank. Hope he knew what he was doing. 
The Legion is more than just Caesar! It's got the momentum of thousands of men behind it.
The Legion is the worst enemy we've ever faced, but we can't stop Caesar here, not without getting a lot of good people killed.
The Legion is twisted, baby - original losers worshipping the king of creeps like he's some kind of god.
The Lieutenant's been talking to you, hasn't he? Look, I don't need a head doctor - I'm First Recon, damn it.
The light switches continued to bicker and flicker.
The little guy. 10 of Spades. I like him because he listens. Doesn't shut up the rest of the time, but when I talk, he listens.
THE LOBOTOMITE HAS RETRIEVED TWO... COUNT THEM, TWO... OF THE THREE TECHNOLOGIES.
THE LOBOTOMITE RETURNS. OUR LOBOTOMITE. HAS DR. MOBIUS BEEN DENOMINATORED INTO SCRAP METAL AND VOICE MODULE PARTS AS WE HOPED?
The Lobotomite taught me that. Taught me a name is more than... um... that I should take pride in... things. Like... names... and... 
The LT t-t-told you about that? Shit. Man, that's sh-sh-shit. 
The LT, Gorobets, gave it to me. See, I w-w-wanted to be Ace of Spades. But the LT says, sorry kid, you're t-t-too green. So he calls me Ten instead. 
The major froze up at the news, and we couldn't get another word out of him. I took over and salvaged the situation as best I could.
The major in charge at the time made a bad call - he thought Bitter Springs was full of Great Khan raiders, so we surrounded the place.
The men looked at each other, looked at us, and asked me what we were going to do about it.
The Misfits' laziness caught up with them when the Legion attacked Camp Golf.
The Mojave has a way of burning decent people up, but it sounds like you've done right by the NCR. It's appreciated. Now what can I do for you?
The most likely source of these new caps is the old sarsaparilla bottling plant. Go there, locate the bottle cap press, and disable it.
The NCR beat  them at the dam three years ago, but that didn't stop them. They've spent the meanwhile gathering strength.
The NCR's the biggest gang of thieves in the Mojave, only difference is they pass laws to make their crimes legal before they commit them.
The next day twenty roll up. So we listened.
The notes count for something. I'll keep them safe. Keely's work in the vault won't be lost, and it won't be forgotten.
The Office of Science and Industry has carefully calculated the amount of water needed for these crops. The whole thing is handled by computer.
The ones left on the dam didn't know what to do. The troopers routed them. Graham pulled the remaining legionaries back, but the battle was over.
The only tribe in the Legion is the Legion. Caesar is their chief, father, and god all rolled into one.
The other modules are rather... erratic, sir. Their personality matrices are built on flawed logic and have not weathered the years well, sir.
The other snipers use bolt-action, but Gorobets reckoned it didn't matter none if I was different, so long as I can hit my targets.
The praetorians covered Graham in pitch, lit him on fire, and down into the Grand Canyon he went.
The quality of the Gun Runners' armaments is due to their manufacturing process. They craft all weapons on-site.
THE RADAR FENCE THAT SURROUNDS THE BIG MT CRATER WILL PREVENT - ER, PROTECT YOU FROM STRAYING BEYOND THE FACILITY.
The rangers assisted the troopers admirably during the Legion's ill-fated attack.
The rangers heroically assisted NCR's troopers in their ill-fated defense against the overwhelming power of Caesar's Legion.
The rangers, along with NCR's many troopers, shared the glory of victory.
The rapist with the flamethrower? Yeah, that's a combination I stay the fuck away from.
THE REST OF YOU SHOULD TRY THIS INTERCOM THING. IT MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE SOME KIND OF... SKY-GOD!
The robots collect House's share of the take every week and life goes on. Ain't exactly what I'd call leadership.
THE SCRUBBING ALSO ENSURES YOUR SILENCE TO KEEP BIG MT SAFE. THIS FACILITY IS TOP SECRET, AND YOU CANNOT SPEAK OF IT TO ANYONE OUTSIDE OF BIG MT.
The Securitrons are where it's at. I need a way to control them, and a way to beef up their hitting power.
The Sink atop the Dome bustled with the voices of a small town, constantly chirping, arguing, and snarling at each other.
The Sink atop the Dome gained a frontier town feel with the few modules installed.
The Sink Central Intelligence Unit discovered, despite its inversion code, it was comforted by the sense of community the other personalities gave it.
The Sink Central Intelligence Unit was impressed by the amount of exploration the Courier had undertaken.
The Sink continued to ruthlessly scrub any particulate matter that came near it.
The Sink sat vigilant, waiting for its master to return, shoes covered in Mojave dust.
The Sink was strangely silent, which it had never been in previous years. The lack of personality modules made the base lifeless and sterile.
THE SLASH... AS A DESIGNATOR OF... WHY, THAT IS BRILLIANT. BUT HOW DID YOU...?
The squad really seems to be working together better. It's nice, for a change.
The Strip ain't nothing but a monster. Chews folks up, sucks out their caps, and spits 'em back out.
THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE THE X-2 TRANSMITTER ANTENNA ARRAY, USED TO FOCUS COHERENT THOUGHT AT EXCESSIVELY HIGH FREQUENCIES.
The things you do with our body are suicidally dangerous, and if you could silence your glandular impulses, you would hear me screaming at you!
The time for talk has passed, honey baby. These mouths of ours have appointments to be elsewhere.
The Toaster continued its psychotic spree, reducing all appliances in range to scrap electronics and spare parts.
The Uncanny Valley research center has been canceled until further notice. As in, until someone notices it. 
The water ration's still a problem, and the NCR doesn't look like it's going to do anything about it anytime soon.
The well's fixed.
Their organization, so reliant on the wisdom and guidance of its elder members, became a shadow of what it once was to people across the wasteland.
Then again, perhaps I'd rather not know. Thank you all the same - I'm very happy to be rid of that man.
Then again... that light is mighty consistent. Always there at 1 AM. Might be worth a look.
Then get yourself out of here and don't come back until you do! Why waste time coming back here, when you could be using that time to continue your search!?
Then get yourself out of here and find it! People are depending on you!
Then get yourself out of here and find the GECK! People are depending on you!
Then he went for Yangtze, got bomb collars, and started practicing on the subjects that were still there until he got the right frequency. 
Then he'd get high with his buddies and swap tales about the folk they killed. Bunch of animals.
Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
Then I or one of the other rangers on duty organize the data, evaluate it, and send information to camps or troopers in the field.
Then I'll fire some shells up in there, make sure he doesn't ever forget me. He left me a bunch of souvenirs - I figure I can do the same.
THEN MAKE WHATEVER CRUDE BIOLOGIC DEMANDS YOU NEED OF THE SINK. IT WILL CATER TO MOST OF YOUR HORMONAL WHIMS.
Then stop bringing it up!
Then take this flask. It is from the holy Vault 13. Vic, a trader in Klamath, brought it to us. He may know where the vault is. You may also need some of what they call money. Here.
Then the skin bubbles like maggots beneath it. Boils grow and burst. Blood runs from your ears and your tongue swells. Those who are lucky choke to death. Those who are not...
Then there's Driver Nephi. He's fast and he's brutal. Killed about a dozen of my men with a goddamn driver iron. Hence his name.
Then they brought us here, to hell. They have killed most of us with something they call effeevee. They will kill us all before they are through! Do you know what must be done, Chosen One?
Then this is endsville, baby - may the best  man win.
THEN THIS MAY BE JUST THE ANSWER WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. AT LAST, A CHANCE TO...
Then we ain't going nowhere.
Then what?
Then, about a week ago, there was a scientist. Keely. She's unusual, not the sort of person you'd expect, but she's an absolute genius, and...
Then, when he ain't looking, you knock him out of the running and find a way to take control of those Securitrons of his.
There are a half-dozen troopers in shouting distance. Best remember that before you try anything.
There are other things I would learn.
There go those glands again. Is the endorphin rush you get from doing the right thing really that good?
There is a negotiation with a smaller trading outfit that I'd like resolved as quickly as possible.
THERE IS NO MORE WE CAN DO TO AID YOU AND OUR PATIENCE LEVELS ARE DEPLETED. NOW GO. REST IN THE SINK IF YOU MUST. BUT LEAVE US TO OUR RESEARCH.
There now. As good as God ever made you. You just mind you keep that leg out of any radioactive waste, and rub liniment on it twice a day.
There was Old World Blues, and New World Hope. And hope ruled the day at Big MT.
There were a lot of mercs. One after another. None of them came back.
There ya go! Have fun with that. Burn the fuckin' world for me!
There you have learned what I can teach you about spears.
There's a big gap between those two things, about as wide as that lake out there.
There's a Doctor Usanagi who's supposed to be good at this sort of thing.
There's a first-class offer on the table. The rest is up to you.
There's a lot of answers to that question, but it started with the Ranger Unification Treaty. We weren't always the only show in town.
There's a small trading outfit, Cassidy Caravans, that I'm interested in acquiring. They've been rather competitive, so it's time to buy them out.
There's also the matter of Henry Jamison, an employee whose services I'd rather do without. His family connections make it difficult, however.
There's more I want to know.
There's more to it, but we don't have the time. By which I mean you don't.
There's more to the 188 than meets the eye. Troops move back and forth on 93 all the time, and 95 is how NCR folks come and go from Vegas.
There's no real equivalent to them in the NCR. Centurions are battle-born, elite officers who earned their rank with blood and sweat.
There's not as many people playing at Gomorrah, so that means I've got better odds of winning big. I got this figured out.
There's over two dozen bodies lying in the dunes way outside of town and five men with .308 rifles crouched behind sand bags.
There's some weird chatter on the radio saying something wiped out Nelson and Forlorn Hope. That's pretty scary.
There's talk from time to time about taking out their base at Red Rock Canyon, but nothing ever comes of it. The Great Khans are tough fighters.
There's the medic at Camp McCarran, but I've also heard there's a civilian doctor in the northeast part of New Vegas. I don't know for sure.
There's two psycho-bastards left. Which one will it be?
There's usually a gun merchant hanging around topside. I'm sure she'll take care of you.
There's voices here in the Big Empty, I want to talk to them. Not like your Elijah did. Got questions. Want to hear history give its answer.
THERE. WE HAVE INFORMED YOU OF ALL WE NEED. WE ESTIMATE IF YOU ARE FOCUSED, YOUR TIME INVESTMENT WILL BE MINIMAL. EH, BY OUR STANDARDS.
THEY ARE IRRITATING.
They aren't the toughest legionaries, but they're the most devoted to Caesar. They believe in everything the Legion stands for.
They brought me to Dhatri after the battle. He was just a Captain, back then. Guess he saw something in me... knew I didn't belong with the Khans.
They built this little shanty town around a well in the middle of nowhere. Called it Rattletail.
They continued to serve with distinction for many years.
They don't. Only the good ones do.
They followed us down there, but we were out before they realized what was happening.
They found the Chip. I wasn't gonna tell them what it was used for, but... let's just say they were persuasive.
They had planted an NCR flag over the well and they would not budge until every last one of them was laid out, dead and cold.
They had themselves some fun with me... mangled my hands and feet pretty good.
They have the best equipment the NCR can get its hands on, power armor salvaged from our war with the Brotherhood.
They know stuff about tech and medicine and usually help out anybody who asks. Can't say I know any more than that.
They made me just to torture me. But you know, it's the neglect that hurts the most. "Hey everybody, let's turn ourselves into robot brains in jars!"
They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
They say the Burned Man still walks the land, blackens the earth wherever he sets foot.
They seemed real happy together. I really oughtta to get to know them better. They're probably nice folk.
They shouted at each other across the HQ occasionally, either threatening each other, or announcing a discovery. It kept things... lively.
They wear special outfits, too, pieced together from the armor of all their defeated enemies. Good commanders, tough opponents.
They work the farms, and in return they get a safe place to stay and clean food and water. Some of 'em aren't all that grateful, though.
They'll drain us dry while we fight and die over this dam. We offered them sanctuary in NCR territory before, but they won't listen.
They'll pay.
They're based out of the old fort in Freeside. They supposedly helped the NCR out at some point, but they go their own way now.
They're called bodyguards, and every one of them is packing. Me, too - so baby makes five.
They're dead. Got themselves killed at Bitter Springs. Served them right, if you ask me.
They're fiercely protective of their technology, and none of them is likely to share it willingly.
They're gonna try to take the dam again, real soon. And if they do, Vegas as we know it will cease to exist.
They're just people who were trying to get to the only well in fifty miles. I didn't have to talk to the men to see that they did not care one bit.
They're not just going to roll off into Arizona if we give them a good shove.
They're part of the deal, the Thaler Act. We work the fields while they protect the crops and the water.
They're scum. Lazy, trumped-up Raiders. Most of the time, they're drunk or high, and when they're not shooting chems, they're selling them.
They're slacking off, and that reflects badly on me.
They're the best of the best and the baddest of the bad. Short of a centurion or praetorian, they don't come any tougher.
They're worse than roaches. My advice? Put on your stomping shoes.
They've got some camps on the eastern shore of the Colorado, and the monstrosity on the hill across the lake - that's for Caesar.
They... well, move sometimes. Or get buried. Or blow up. 
Thing is, there's a lot of assholes in the army. I keep hoping they'll pair me up with some hot blonde, like you see on those old pinups.
Thing is, there's a lot of assholes in the army. Now if they paired me up with somebody who looks like you...
Think twice before you decide to give the old chief a gut full of lead.
Think you can take down another one of these scumbags? Up to you. But I can trust you to do the job, and I'd hate to see you walk away.
Thinking hurts you, too? Aw, I wish I could let you have the one on my head but I can't. It hurts real bad when I don't wear it.
Third, you need to listen to me more than your hormonal choir and genitalian orchestra. Promise me that, and you've got a deal.
This again? All right. What do you want to know?
This debugging obsession of yours really has you hooked. Either that, or is this is one weird hobby. 
This doesn't look too bad. We'll have you good as new in no time.
This glittering blue light beam forest cleanly bisected anything that entered its depths, slicing them into small, segmented parts for easy disposal.
This human... I can't believe it... he broke out of the Think Tank. In seconds. 
This is Christine Royce. Knight of the Brotherhood of Steel... the Circle. 
This is Christine Royce. KnightA of the Brotherhood of Steel... the Circle. 
This is Cook-cook? You sure did a number on his face. I'm not allowed to give you the full reward, but thanks for taking this guy down.
This is going to make me sick, isn't it?
This isn't a public relations office. If you're not here about a bounty, you can go pester the Colonel.
This job isn't all gunfighting and gulping shots of whiskey, no matter what the boys and ladies out there say.
This job's boring enough without talking to you. Go see Alexander.
This little care package is everything I need. I'll take it from here.
This might tickle a little. Or it might cause searing, agonizing pain to shoot through your body. You never know.
This persisted until the day someone dropped a flashlight in the Sink, and the two of them united in their hatred of the "showboat."
This spirit of forgiveness you're showing me... it's enough to make a player rethink what it means to win. You're 18 karat, baby - all the way.
This spirit of forgiveness you're showing me... it's enough to make a player rethink what it means to win. You're 18 karat, baby. Catch you later.
This thing on my head is headache medicine. It works real good, except I can't think when it's on. Really think, I mean.
This unfortunate circumstance will prevent us from immediately using their blueprints to manufacture weapons. A pity.
This war is gonna bankrupt the NCR, unless we finish off the Legion fast and dirty. 
This was none of their business - or yours. You've got no right to talk to people behind my back about this.
This will take a little while.
THIS... IS THE THINK TANK, THE NERVE CENTER OF BIG MT, THE GREATEST RESEARCH CENTER KNOWN TO MAN. AND TO US.
This? The OSI lab. We don't get many visitors. The smell puts people off, I think.
Those kids didn't desert. They just got liquored up on the Strip and missed roll call.
THOSE WERE WORDS, WEREN'T THEY? IN THE FORM OF QUESTIONS. IT'S ASKING ME QUESTIONS. IS THIS SOME KIND OF TRICK?
Those who weren't killed in the attack attempted to flee, but were caught at Mojave Outpost, court-martialed, and hanged from the ranger monument.
Though Camp Golf fell to Caesar, the Misfits distinguished themselves during the Legion's attack.
Though General Oliver and Chief Hanlon were both praised for their leadership, the chief quietly stepped out of the spotlight.
Though many NCR military officers fled the territory soon after the dam was lost, Chief Hanlon remained at Camp Golf to surrender to the Legion.
Though some in NCR regarded Hanlon as a traitor, many believed he was the only military commander who saw the futility in defending New Vegas.
Though the Courier snatched victory from NCR, only General Oliver was blamed for the loss of Hoover Dam.
Thought the first one was going to be lobotomized in Y-17, she got out somehow. 
Thought you might be the last chance for the Mojave... the West. The East. But you're all the same mind, obsessed.
Times are tough back home. Too many people, not enough work. Unless you like shoveling brahmin shit.
To protect against all forms of tyranny. As simple as that. Thirty, forty years ago, the wasteland was full of despots.
To start, I'll comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. You deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
To think I deemed that flintbox my lucky charm. Oh, the irony...
Took some skill to bring down that Fiend. You done good.
Tracked a rogue Brotherhood Elder, Elijah, here, to the Big Empty. Place is more than it seems, there's a crater hidden deep inside.
Tragically, the core operating systems are also located on the personality tapes, sir.
Tried to see what makes them tick. Can't even examine them without them detonating all over me. Left with shrapnel and burns. Every. Time. 
Troopers and rangers have been dying here for more than five years while the families sit pretty behind that... damned wall.
Troopers have enough to deal with. We don't want them questioning their intel.
Trouble is, the Chip don't fit any computer I've found. Must require special hardware.
Trust me, the alpha males are overrated. Plenty of them in the army. All they're good for is killing each other and taking smelly shits.
Truth be told, my emotional attachment to it doesn't even register compared to just having people recognize the difference! 
Truth is, his eyes just suck.
Two are more alike than you know, too wrapped in the wrong bits of history to see ahead. Not judging. I know how it is.
TWO AS IN TOO LATE.
TWO AS IN TOO LATE. 
Two other human specimens. One arrived not long after the troublemaker... and the last one, not sure when he showed up. 
Ugh! It's bad enough the indignities you've put me through, must you continue to prattle on at me?
Ugh, it's just so... unsanitary! Do you know how many germs are in one cubic centimeter of dirt? Seventy... hundred... gajillion!
Ugh... It's not that I didn't like being in your head, you understand. As far as heads go, it was a rather nice one.
Ugh?!
Uh -huh!
Uh oh.
Uh, Aunt Morlis, I have three right here.
Uh, if you're done, can we move again? My biogel's starting to crampagulate. 
Uh-kay.
Uh.
Uh... What was my quest again?
Uhh... duh?
Uhhh?
UM, YOU CAN GO NOW. THAT'S YOUR CUE.
UM. NO.
Umm, I guess not.
Umm, okay. Sorry.
Ummm, Mynoc said...
Unfortunately, before we get to that stage of the proceedings, we have a problem.
Unless I hear from Keely, we've got nothing to talk about.
Unless of course the batteries run out, but that seems unlikely.
Unless you dipped that in cheese fondue, I'd say it's infected. Let me fix that up for you.
Unlike certain other lightswitches, I'm competent. I'd just love to turn those lights on for you.
Upon the military's return, debate raged within NCR's senate about who was to blame for the loss of Hoover Dam.
Used to be a Ranger... one of the first they sent out east, back before we took the Dam. Observation and reconnaissance.
Used to have a settlement up at Bitter Springs, 'til they pissed off NCR and got slaughtered for their trouble.
Vegas always chewed men up... it's just a little more literal, nowadays.
Vegas gotta swing, baby, gotta have pizzazz. Respect where due, but that old man is square to the core.
Vegas is bleeding us dry. We're tossing caps at a hundred different problems, while Caesar bides his time and lets us wear ourselves out.
Very good indeed, sir. "Throwing out the riff-raff" protocols engaged. All personality matrices are off-line, sir.
Very good sir. Merely interface the holotapes with my console's input/output port, and I shall upload them directly.
Very good, sir.
Very good, sir. And might I venture to opine that a new Trilby might be just the thing to complete sir's ensemble?
Very good, sir. If I might suggest a table wine, the 64 Atomic Claret is a lovely little vintage.
Very good, sir. Should sir be in the market for a new suit of morning wear, I have several suggestions that might suit.
Very good. On occasion it's proven to be more profitable in the long run to simply buy out the competition, and this is one of those occasions.
Very well, I suppose I have no choice. Goodbye peaceful, soothing brain jar, hello head wounds and scorpions.
Very well, let me put this in terms you'll understand. Brain: smart. Heart: stupid. Spine: very stupid. You: exceptionally stupid.
Very well. I'm on my way.
Very well. See me when you decide - but do not wait too long.
Very well. What job did you need more information on?
VERY WELL... PARTNER. THE THINK TANK IS AT YOUR SERVICE. AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT DESTROY US.
Violet it is. Wish I could give you more advice on how to bring her down, but we know less about her than the other two.
Violet's got dogs. Lots of dogs. While they're ripping you to shreds up close, she'll be putting rounds through you with her rifle.
Wahh!!! I'm really thirsty but the well's broken!
Wahh!!! Please fix the well.
Wahh!!! The well really needs fixing.
Wait  until we get to the Presidential,  pally. I don't need you tugging at my sleeve.
Wait a moment - pencil processors off-line? Pencil processors off-line?! Apologies, Citizen, it seems traitors have absconded with that module.
Wait for me in the Presidential suite. We got a future together, you and me. It's time we got started.
Wait. If what you're theorizing is this Lobotomite understands us... can reason with us... 
Was a time I would've agreed with you. But this... it's too big, it affects too many people. I can't get hung up on those details.
WAS THAT MY PLAN? IT MUST HAVE BEEN. SOMETIMES I TRULY SURPRISE MYSELF. THE DOOR IS OPEN... AND NOW, MOBIUS WILL GET HIS.
Wasn't much good with a pistol after that. Wasn't gonna be trekking across the waste on any more long scouts, either.
Way I see it, Bitter Springs was my beat-down. So afterward... I gave myself a name. It's all I've got from the Khans, and it's all I ever want.
WE ARE BIGGER, SMARTER, AND FLOATIER THAN YOU, LOBOTOMITE. WE DON'T WISH TO FIGHT YOU, SO SURRENDER YOUR BRAIN. NOW.
WE ARE LABORING AWAY SCIENTIFICALLY ON YOUR BEHALF. TOILLESS RESEARCHERS THAT IS WHAT WE ARE. TOIL. TOIL. TOIL.
We are reading increased levels of berserkity in Securitrons from the De-Construction Plant. 
We came here about a month ago, when Primm went to hell on account of the prison break north of there. Found a bin to call home and set up shop.
We came here from Primm about a month past. Doesn't look like much, but it's one hell of a location.
We can't have wastelanders popping in here for a free meal, so my squad and I are assigned to keep things from going to hell.
We could give it Mobius' old room. It's where its brain got scooped out anyway, and plus, some of its parts are already there. 
WE COULD HAVE ESCAPED, SEEN IT ALL FOR OURSELVES. TESTED IT, PRODDED AT IT. MADE IT SQUIRM.
We could say more, but the stories in the Big Empty speak for themselves.
We get 'em coming and going. Coming, the suckers flush with caps they saved to gamble on the Strip...
We get the water - clean water - pumped in from Lake Mead. If you follow the big pipes, they'll take you all the way to the Lake.
We gotta problem, boys!
We had packed the old city with C4 and dynamite. Crude, but it did the job. Those who didn't die in the blast were in no position to mount a defense.
WE HAD TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS AFTER THE LAST VISITORS. THEY CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE IN A SHORT TIME.
WE HAVE NO IDEA! THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING ISN'T IMPORTANT TO US RIGHT NOW! WHY ARE YOU ASKING THESE TANGENTIAL QUESTIONS? STOP IT!
We know they supply the Fiends with illegal chems, but they never stick around in NCR territory for long. They know the land, and move quick.
We make it a point to scour Pre-War bottling plants and recover or disable the bottle cap presses. It seems we missed one.
We must have been on the trail for a week before we got to Rattletail. We lost one woman to Night Stalkers and another almost died of dehydration.
WE NEED THESE TECHNOLOGIES. YOU NEED TO GET THEM. YOU MUST GET THEM.
We neglected the dams or pumped all the water out a long time ago. Owens, Isabella, the San Luis. Drained the aquifers of everything they had.
We observed a fascinating phenomenon: certain spectra of visible light actually increased cognitive function and reasoning ability.
We rely on each other too much to let our infirmities become a liability. A ranger knows when it's time. Only I didn't.
We set up this ranch years back when Novac was just getting settled.
We shouldn't be perched up at the Dam - we ought to be crossing the Colorado and sticking a boot up Caesar's ass.
We shouldn't even be talking about this, I know. But I think someone should tell you. You're not the first one he's sent to Vault 22.
We think it was the Brotherhood of Steel - those crazies always go hard for energy weapons. But the NCR would rather pretend they killed all of them.
We took the lay of the land, checked out the locals, and kept ourselves inconspicuous. Couple friends of mine were the first to scout the Dam.
We used to. But every caravan carrying them was getting ambushed and wiped out. By someone sophisticated enough to know which was which.
WE WANT YOU TO STOP HIM. SOMEHOW. WITH SCIENCE.
We were east of Vegas when the first Securitron we ever saw rolled up on us. We junked it in a minute flat.
We were nomadic badasses, not to be trifled with. A gang of ruffians, though with a certain panache.
We were sending robots to stop him and he was slicing and cutting through their shells with some suped-up laser gun like they were cheese... paper. 
We would have to make use of Dr. Klein's lab, and I rather doubt the brains are inclined to share.
We'll be able to use the schematics you acquired to begin manufacturing our own weapons immediately. We'll provide some to you at a discount.
We'll be unable to make use of their schematics any time soon. Not what I was hoping for when I asked you to do the job. Take your pay.
We'll get ourselves into position. See you at the rock crushing plant.
We're all set up. You just lure Nephi close.
We're at your service, if you need us. Until Driver Nephi is dead. Major's orders.
We're fighting on their behalf, but Mr. House and the families are stringing us up, inch by inch.
We're going, we're going!
We're smart. Smarter than we give ourselves credit for. I was smart enough to talk to you, give you a chance - and now look what happened! 
We're stretched thin and the Long 15 just keeps getting longer. Slow to get supplies. Slower to get reinforcements.
We're the definition of cool, baby. We know how to swing. Folks come to us to learn how to enjoy themselves.
We're the finest sniper outfit in the whole NCR. If you need a bullet put into a target's eye from 800 yards away, you call us.
We're the NCR's #1 supplier of weapons and ammunition. You might call us an unofficial branch of the army.
Welcome back.
Welcome home, Citizen! Find any seditious materials out there?
Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. How can I help you?
Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. Like our slogan says, "It's better than nothing."
Welcome to the Crimson Caravan Company, New Vegas branch. What may I do for you?
Welcome, brother! How can I help you?
Welcome, sister! How can I help you?
Well ain't you a sentimental broad? Gimme a sec to jump off Cloud 9, I'll meet you on the ground...
WELL DONE, LOBOTOMITE. SOON, THE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE SAFE.
Well done. I'm very pleased to be rid of that man.
Well hey, the field's wide open, now that I'm gone. Probably lots of people looking to get in, once they hear I quit.
Well shit, feel free to stick a knife in the old ego. I thought I'd made a name for myself around here.
WELL, AND YOUR BRAIN, OF COURSE. IT WOULD KNOW AS WELL.
Well, as long as your curiosity is satisfied.
Well, certainly there might be some things I miss about being ambulatory. We have seen some incredible sights, haven't we?
Well, except for Dr. O, who was an asshole for having created Muggy in the first place.
Well, firstly I would say providing wholeness of the body is service enough, but if you must know, I'm also programmed with cosmetical subroutines.
Well, hello there! Can I get you a drink?
Well, hello! Still waiting for that seed.
Well, here you are again. Have you once again failed to complete your quest?
Well, I know Major Dhatri is offering bounties on some of the Fiends - that's the gang that controls the southeast part of the city.
Well, I see sarcasm hasn't eluded you. Fine, perhaps now isn't the best time, but it's the principle of the thing.
Well, I'll be right here if you change your mind.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Only one thing concerns me right now, and that's killing the bastards that are murdering my men.
Well, if you ask me, what we really need is to get the whole squad out on the practice range - shape up our marksmanship and explosives skill.
Well, it's the strangest thing. Last time it happened I could swear I heard someone cry out for help. Sounded like a big fella.
Well, maybe next time you hear me telling you that charging a Nightkin with a penknife is a bad idea, you'll listen.
Well, not all the time, anyway,
WELL, NOT HIDDEN, IT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE, BEHIND THE PROGRAMMING EQUIVALENT OF COFFEE STAINS...
Well, of course it does. That's the most lethal of mathematics... 
Well, since I can't kill you, I guess I have to listen to your inane questions.
Well, that could be Violet, or it could be someone else entirely. I'll take your word for it, but I can't give you a full reward.
Well, that was enough for them. They packed up what they could and we took them back north. Last I heard, they settled somewhere in Anza- Borrego.
Well, that'll do just fine.
Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do! Me! A, quote, dick, unquote. As if I'm the one responsible for the way you carry on, gadding about the Wastes.
Well, that's an interesting question. Among the Church, I'm called Elder Gunnarsson. The Followers call me "Doc."
Well, the Gun Runners continue to dominate the weapons market, and the Mormon traders from New Canaan control the majority of the northern routes.
Well, the important thing is that you're good and decisive about these things.
Well, then, take two shots of whiskey and call me in the morning. Heh heh, little doctor humor. Okay, let's have a look.
Well, then, why are you wasting my time?
Well, then. I suppose this is goodbye for now. What will you do?
Well, there's what we're supposed to be doing and what we're actually doing.
Well, we certainly wouldn't want to strain your comprehension, would we?
WELL, WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO IT. WE TRIED TO CLEAN UP AFTER, AS ALWAYS, BUT USUALLY THE AUTO-DOC RUNS ON REMOTE. BUT WE PROGRAMMED IT. OR, MOBIUS DID.
Well, well, look who finally dragged themselves in out of the Wasteland. And where have we been, hmm? Crawling through pits of radioactive muck again?
Well, well, well. Driver Nephi. Nothing to say, you son of a bitch? No tips on my golf swing?
Well, well... what have we got here? Another innocent little toaster. Come here, I won't hurt you... hah! Gotcha!
Well, yeah.
Well, you ain't the fittest horse that ever ran a race, but you don't appear in immediate danger of keeling over. I can patch you up if you want.
Well, you got that right.
Well, you're too late - I just quit the bounty trade. Soon as I pick up some caps that Dhatri owes me, I'm out of this scrapyard.
Well, you've proven yourself reliable so far. Would you be interested in more important jobs?
WELL. GOOD. WHAT ARE THE TOKEN WORDS SPOKEN IN THIS CASE... UH... "THANK YOU?" YES - THANK. YOU.
WELL. NO. NOT CURRENTLY.
Well... I suppose you've convinced me well enough. I'll rejoin your body if that's your final decision.
Well... I want three doses of healing powder. Bad times are coming and I'm going to be ready. Bring them to me and you can have the flint. Now get to it!
Well... Oh, very well. Here is the flint. I wish you a safe journey, child. 
Well... that wasn't really a matter of choice. Got myself caught by Legionnaires, up near Malpais.
Well... the logical thing to do is to check with the patrol rangers and comm officers. Don't be too discouraged if some things don't match up.
Well... There's been reports of trouble south, but me and Michelle can handle ourselves. And there's plenty of soldiers about, so that helps.
Well... this is payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
Well... we're still better off than we were. Maybe one of my snipers will get lucky. If not, and you change your mind... you know where I'll be.
Well... you know how we asked it to fetch the Sonic Emitter thing? Turns out we already have it. What are the odds? 
Well? What are you waiting for? Get moving and leave me in peace.
Weren't as many of us to go around. But I think it was a lot easier to tell the good guys from the bad.
Westside, huh? I hope the NCR does something about those thieving bastards. I appreciate it, and so do the rest of the farmers.
What a pointless trip. Here I thought I'd get a shot at that junkie bastard. 
What about it?
What about it? I don't feel like arguing it with you, too. 
What am I gonna say?  "No thanks?"
What are we going to do? There's no way we can breach the Forbidden Zone. There's those robot scorpions everywhere! 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK? MOBIUS' THREATS PERSIST! WORSE, HE'S FILLING UP OUR TRANSMISSION STORAGE HOLOTAPE TO CAPACITY!
What brings you here?
What can I do for you?
What can you teach me?
What did accomplishments ever do for us? Please. 
WHAT DID WE SPEAK ABOUT...? MELANCHOLY FELLOW, HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT... HISTORY? BUT...
What did you have in mind? You thinking of luring him into range of my snipers?
What did you think all those self-preservation instincts were, hmm?
What do you need?
What do you think you are doing, child? This is no way for the Chosen One to act. Now get out of my sight!
What do you want?
What else did you want to know?
What form that might take, though, I cannot say.
What gave me away? The big gun, the shades, or the attitude? 
What good is eradicating sedition if the malcontents have ready access to the means to make more, Citizen? I can also process pencils and clipboards!
What happened?
What I did to you was rotten, but if you think House, the NCR or Caesar won't kill to put Vegas in their pocket, I really did blow out your brains.
WHAT ILLOGIC IS THIS?! KEEP YOUR FILTHY PENIS-TIPPED FEET OUT OF OUR LABS AND SECRETS!
What in the goddamn...?
What in the goddamn...? 
WHAT IS HE DOING?
What is it, trooper? You're not assigned to my squad, as far as I know.
What is it?
WHAT IS IT? THE LOBOTOMITE IS ASKING ME THINGS, O, AND I AM TRYING TO IGNORE THEM. MY PROCESSORS CAN'T IGNORE YOU BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.
What is it? You know I have a lot to do!
WHAT IS THIS, A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE FAIR?! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, YOU'RE MAKING US LOOK LIKE A COLLECTION OF ROUND-EARTHERS!
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU SOUND... BRAIN-SCRUBBED, BLINDLY AGREEING WITH THE LOBOTOMITE. WHAT...?
What kind of dumbass question is that? Of course I want payback.
What say you and me cash out, go somewheres more private-like? Any questions you got, I'll answer.
What the fuck...?
What the hell are you looking at, punk?
What the hell happened with these readiness reports? These scores are way too high!
What the hell's going on here?
What was I supposed to do again?
What were you doing - trying to get me killed in the temple?
What would you like to know?
What ya talking about? I been ready!
What's the haps?
What's the next step, then?
What? Ask the Lobotomite for help? 8, I think you need the fluid levels in your logic-assist-pumps checked. 
What? Hey, guys! Help me here!
What? How could you do that?
What? Like... stuff? Things? 
What? Me? Breaking news, Klein, it wasn't me - all right?! I am the robotical engineer, 8 is soundwaves, that's his "specialty." 
WHAT? YOU DID? YOUR SURVIVAL, LET ALONE SUCCESS, BARELY REGISTERED ON MY PROJECTIONS.
Whatcha want, freakshow?
Whatever the reason, it slowed down for a while, carefully appraising each document and clipboard that came to it.
Whatever you need, we'll make sure it gets done.
Whatever you say. Hey, is that a little patch of ghoul rot on your cheek there?
Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying.
When 15 shut down, 95 became the route NCR citizens use to get to the Strip - or limp back home, after the Strip's drained 'em of caps.
When he hacked into the mainframe, 8 tried to stop him and got fried. Me? He rerouted my processors to take control of the train network here. 
When House gave us the Tops to renovate, his robots dropped off boxes full of suits and ties and wingtip shoes. Told us we were the "Chairmen" now.
When NCR slaughtered the Khans at Bitter Springs, I hadn't got my beat-down yet. I was still too young.
When the Courier's body finally passed, the brain was saddened. It kept on, remembering the vessel that had once contained it.
When the Legion attacked Hoover Dam, General Oliver ordered his troopers back to the middle ground just after first contact.
When they show their faces, that's when we go to work. One shot, one k-k-kill. That's the First Recon way.
When traffic dried up, we took to our heels to find us some customers. I'm not one to sit around waiting to get saved, and Michelle ain't, neither.
When we reach the place, it's six shacks set up around an old well.
When you're ready to saddle up, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll plan the next step of this caper.
When you've lived as long as she has, you get defensive around new people. Who wants to make a friend when you know you'll outlive them?
Where is Vault 13?
Where once it was viewed as a form of sadness, nostalgia, it became an expression describing the potential for the future.
Where was I supposed to go?
While the brute force approach is a lovely one, really, it won't work.
While we were trying to keep containment on the surface, turns out he used one train to punch out a tunnel and escape... sealed now, but... 
WHILE YOU ARE HERE, YOU WILL REFER TO THIS PLACE PROPERLY - AND YOU WILL DO THE SAME WITH THE OTHER... SCIENTISTS HERE.
While you were away, my plans have marched steadily forward. Beware, Caesar! Beware, NCR! Soon will dawn the Age of the Toaster!
White was talking to me about computer stuff and water delivery schedules through the pipes, but I'm just a farmer. Tech stuff is beyond me.
Who am I? I'm the scariest motherfucker you're ever gonna meet. I'm Cook-Cook, bitch, better not forget it.
Who asked you? You just wait until a working machine threatens you, and you'll wish I was around! 
Who the fuck are you and why are you bothering me?
Who wants to know? You here for my dogs? Can't have my dogs. Here for meat? Can't have my meat. Meat's for dogs.
Who's the flatware bitch now, O?!
Whole things smells of Caesar to me. 'Course, that's just guesswork, but I'd still bet a few caps that he's stirring up the locals against us.
WHY AM I EVEN LISTENING TO YOU FOOLS? ENOUGH OF THIS MUTINOUS CHORUS! IF THERE'S A WORD I HATE, IT'S "MUTINY."
WHY AM I EVEN LISTENING TO YOU FOOLS? THE DETERMINATORS ARE GREATER THAN THE HESITATORS. SO HESITATORS, BE QUIET.
WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THIS? YOU'VE NEVER REFUSED TO COMMIT NECESSARY... SURGERY BEFORE. AND THIS LOBOTOMITE NEEDS ITS SURGERY.
Why are you even talking to me? If I need any bonding, I'll go find two ionized molecules to smash. 
Why are you here? Every minute you waste another of our people could be killed. And don't forget the GECK! We must have it.
Why didn't you say so? No problem. I'll give you my free cure. Here, lean in. It's a special doctor secret.
Why do you bother me, nephew? Can't you see I'm busy?
Why do you bother me, niece? Can't you see I'm busy?
Why do you do this?
Why do you want mugs? Huh? You some kind of sick mug hoarder? Oh god, give me the coffee cup, please! It's sitting there in your pack, taunting me!
WHY DOES HE SEEK OUR DESTRUCTION? WHY DID HE BUILD ROBOT SCORPIONS WITH INTELLIGENCE-DRAINING STINGERS?
Why don't you make the Lobotomite a bottlecap factory, Klein? Or better yet, give it a ton of things to activate the chip? 
Why don't you take some time to brush up on your knowledge so we can keep things... stimulating?
Why not? Ain't like I got nothing to prove. Not like that Toaster - now that boy got some issues.
Why would I do that, baby? I want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to me.
WHY WOULD YOU REASON WITH THAT MANIAC? HE'LL DESTROY US ALL!
Why, you poor dear! Come over here and have a drink, wash off some of that... horrible, sticky... blood.
Will sir be staying for any considerable length of time during sir's visit?
Will you take some free advice from your brain? Don't trust the Think Tank. They aren't... right. In the brain, I mean.
Wish I had a few grunts as good as you. Damn good working with you.
Wish I'd gotten a bullet in that Fiend...
Wish me luck, Elder, and I will not fail you.
Wish they got here a bit earlier, but that's the senate for you.
With an attitude like that, it's small wonder you got yourself shot in the head.
With any luck, I'll see you in the Sink when this is all over.
With Caesar and a new legate here, the Legion's not going to fall for the same old bag of tricks.
With Caesar's victory came a small measure of vindication for the rangers' late Chief Hanlon.
With Hanlon's plot against the occupation exposed and Oliver denounced for losing Hoover Dam, many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home.
With Hanlon's plot against the occupation exposed and Oliver hailed as NCR's new war hero, many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home.
WITH IT, WE CAN FINALLY LEAVE THIS PLACE. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW BORING THIS PLACE GETS, CHOPPING UP THE LANDSCAPE AND EVERYTHING IN IT.
With regret comes a girl... smiling sad, brown robe, name Veronica, half here. Wraps her and her heart up like a pack, in the pack, a key, some say. 
With the brains dealt with, soon we can spread our rule across the Mojave! All will eat burned toast and despair!
With the Courier at the helm, it was all this and more.
With the Courier at the helm, Science became a beacon for the future.
Won't that keep you happy and docile, Citizen?
Word got back to one of our stations that raiders had been attacking the place. I went out with six rangers.
Word is that the Legion's old timers have shown up, Caesar's veterans from the Red Okie Centuria and what was the Painted Rock tribe.
Worry about House? Why would I do that? Hope he died alone in a dingy room, streaming his last remaining bodily fluids into jars. 
Worst of the worst! A tribe of degenerate losers led by a creep. They crucify people for kicks! Slaughter whole towns!
Would you want that getting washed down your gullet day in and day out? I didn't think so!
Wouldn't believe me when I told him to forget it. I mean, if that slab of meat had gotten me pregnant, then maybe I'd want to talk to a doctor. 
Wow, the big celebrity down here with the common troopers. What can I do for you?
Wow-ee wow wow, girl. This is all kinds of wrong, but I'm in for a dozen.
X-12 IS CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. ON AN UNRELATED NOTE, WHOEVER CLOSED X-12, PLEASE REPORT TO THE DOME.
Yeah, 8, no need to brag. Wherever your brain is, it's transmitting thoughts to you through the... what... the, um... uh... 
Yeah, and I needsterile medical supplies. But let's see what I have with me.
Yeah, crazy right? Something right out of a Midnight Science Fiction Feature. Ridiculous. What are the odds? 
Yeah, doesn't sound like me at all, right? But it happens.
Yeah, hello... Well, serves me right for using a 9mm.
Yeah, I do. It wasn't always "O." I had took that one by default because sometimes it's easier to accept the mistake as long as the purpose works. 
Yeah, I do. Thanks. I think we might survive this now.
Yeah, I was there. I was Captain Dhatri, then. That whole situation was a mess and could easily have been avoided with good intel.
Yeah, I'll s-s-see you around.
Yeah, I... uh... "discovered" more internal parts in the monitors here. If you could, uh, hold on to my "discovery," I'd appreciate it. 
Yeah, it's a tricky world out there. I'll tell it to you straight.
Yeah, look... he's not my real father. He just looked after me, for a while.
Yeah, r-right. That's Brahmin shit. Lucky for you we're on b-b-base, and I can't start trouble with civvies. How 'bout you get l-l-lost?
Yeah, real popular  around here. It's a crowd pleaser.
Yeah, right. Bitch.
Yeah, right. Dick.
Yeah, right. You're sniffing up the wrong skirt. Try me again when you're tall, blonde, and female. 
Yeah, that's one word for it.
Yeah, there were a few under the monitors here. Here you go. Keeps the place tidy. 
Yeah, to die in my sleep at a ripe old age after a marathon session of hey-hey with thirty sex-starved broads. You'll set that up?
Yeah, we don't come into your lab and decant your solutions. 
Yeah, we lost that part of the schematics. Or Borous did. In one of his stupid labs - or inside one of his stupid pets. 
Yeah, we talked about it, but that went a big fat nowhere.
Yeah, well, laugh it up on your own time.
Yeah, well, we can't all be heartless shitheads, right?
Yeah, what about it? I told you, we need marksmanship and explosive handling improvements.
Yeah, yeah. Stop yelling.
Yeah, yeah. You're beginning to sound like a broken disk...
Yeah, you like that, don't you baby?
Yeah. I mean, no, they're okay people, but they don't care, y'know? They don't have any ambition. No drive.
Yeah. So what? I could take a bullet in the skull tomorrow. I haven't got time to take it slow and subtle. 
Yeah. That's probably best.
Yeah. The LT shouldn't have b-brought that shit up. Not with civvies, anyway. Ain't right.
Yeah. Try not to get killed.
Yeah. Typical. Thing is, that fat pile of shit sneaked up on us from behind and kicked little 10 in the back of the head. 
Yeah. We spot for each other, watch each other's backs. Usually works pretty well, unless you get paired up with an asshole.
Yeah. You just walk away. No fool can trump the T-t-ten of Spades!
Yeah... getting butchered like livestock. Something to aspire to.
Yeah... I always scare off the hot ones... 
Yeah... that's Cook-cook. Did he always smell like this? Even before he was dead? And the Fiends let this guy touch their food?
Yeah?
Yeah? What about it?
Years back, we met with the Desert Rangers at Mojave Outpost and agreed to help them against Caesar if they would join the NCR.
Yep, I'm still here. Shit, I got nothing better to do, right?
Yes and no. The Blackfoots don't exist anymore, just like any other tribe that gets swallowed by the Legion.
Yes of course, by all means take your time.
Yes yes, all right, bravo, you've come up with something I neglected to consider. There'll be no living with you now. So, what do we do about this?
Yes! Flee before my terrible power!
Yes! Yes! Soon my work will be complete! Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire!
Yes, and they have been for decades now. The hired hands know what they're signing up for - we don't hide anything with fancy talk.
Yes, Aunt Morlis, but...
Yes, Aunt Morlis.
Yes, Aunt Morlis. I mean no, Aunt Morlis. Uh, I've got to go, Aunt Morlis.
YES, BECAUSE THE INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGED SEE AN "M" AND A "T" NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND TAKE OCCAM'S RAZOR TO IT.
Yes, but at significant cost. I understand that you not only agreed that the company pay off his gambling debts, but he also gets severance.
Yes, Dr. Klein? What? 
Yes, Elder.
Yes, he said he was looking into the water shortage, but I haven't heard back from him. Got the feeling he wasn't here in any official way.
Yes, here they are.
Yes, I heard. I believe we're now responsible for paying off his gambling debts, but that you bargained him down from a more outrageous demand.
Yes, I rather thought so.
Yes, I understand that he's decided to quit outright and not even ask for compensation. I'm a bit curious what exactly you said to him.
Yes, I'd heard something about his untimely death. There will be a lot of questions from his family, so I trust you had nothing to do with this.
Yes, ma'am!
Yes, please do.
Yes, the others in the squad said you'd come to them about her. It's a start, but let's hope she sticks with her treatment as long as it's necessary.
Yes, well, believe me, the opposite is equally true. Good Lord, have you bathed at all since they pulled me out of you?
YES, YOU CAN. YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT I CAN SEE.
YES.
YES. BUT NOT CURRENTLY.
YES. HMMM. AH, YES. YESSS... YES... AH. HMMM.
YES. IN ALL PROBABLE LIKELIHOODS, YES. POSSIBLY.
YES. IT IS OUR ONLY CHANCE, A DESPERATE PLAN THAT CAME TO US AFTER MOBIUS' FIRST BROADCAST.
YES. SIMPLY... SPEAK TO IT. WITH VERBAL WORDS TRANSMITTING IN AN OPEN AIR MEDIUM.
Yes. Talk to Betsy and try to convince her to get medical help for her trauma. I sure hope you understand what I'm asking.
YES. THINGS. 
YES. WAIT. YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?
YES. YOU MAY NEED TO WIGGLE IT IN A BIT, BUT DON'T FORCE IT. WE CAN'T RE-CODE THEM IF YOU BREAK IT.
You a merc? 'Cause you don't look like a prospector...
You a merc? Then I guess you'd want to talk to my, uh... father. Major Dhatri. He's our CO.
You all had a new flag. Thought maybe new ideas along with it. What you believe isn't any better than the Bear or Bull. No future in either.
You always do this, you always demean me in front of guests! And it's not "O," all right, it's...! 
You and me at Gomorrah, rolled up in those silk sheets. I got leave coming up in a bit, so let me know if you'll be around.
You and me gonna accomplish great things, baby.
You are a traitor!
YOU ARE LYING. NO, YOU ARE NOT. YOUR HEARTBEAT, PERSPIRATION... ALL EXCESSIVELY CONFIDENT AND SURE OF YOURSELF.
You are not quick enough in combat for my training to help you, Chosen One.
You are! Yes that's right!
You are, without a doubt, the healthiest son of a bitch I've ever seen wandering the Big Empty. Ain't got no use for an old digital sawbones like me.
You bet I can!
You bet I can! I bet that's more than that other tramp can do, huh?
You bet.
You better make it worthwhile. I ain't going to risk my neck in The Wasteland for shit.
You bring me a head that looks like a rotten tomato, people will be doubting, and I won't be authorized to pay the entire bounty.
You came through for us. I have to admit... I wasn't sure you'd make it.
You can call me Bert, though.
You can find the major at the camp just outside of the old airport.
You can have as much as you like! Just, eh... please don't put your lips on the faucet? It's so unsanitary.
You can tell the Lieutenant that I caved. And... thanks.
You can tell the Lieutenant that I finally caved. I'll... get help. There's a Doctor Usanagi who's supposed to be good at this sort of thing.
You cashed out the old man?  So how's it feel to end an era?
You come across a pack of them, weigh your options carefully.
YOU DARE USE LOGIC AGAINST ME?!
You did good and you did it well. Work a ranger would be proud of. I'll handle the rest from here.
You did good out there. Glad you let me get a piece of Nephi. 
You do know these old roads were numbered, right? We're standing where the 95 and 93 meet. And 95 plus 93 equals... 188.
You don't have to leave, girl. Better yet, come and find me when I'm off duty.
You don't have to see the man to see the effect he has.
You don't notice anything unusual about the brahmin.
You don't see the others crying about every little bruise and scrape, do you?
You don't wanna do that, baby - not without hearing what I got to say first.
You don't want to do that, baby. Whatever's down in that bunker is the key to the city called Vegas. So here's what you do...
You find one, you bring it on back here, and we'll burn this mother down!
You fink! Murdering me like this, down on my knees?
You forgive me? After what I done? Baby, are you trying to make me cry?
You found my Smart Lights! Installing upgrade.
YOU GIVE IT TO THE LOBOTOMITE. I'M NOT TOUCHING THAT THING.
You go after them - any of them - you're in for a hell of a fight. So... which one is it going to be?
You go down there and use the Chip to do whatever Mr. House woulda wanted you to do. And when you get back to the Strip, you find Yes Man.
You got a crazy drop on me, baby, but you don't want to kill me. It's like I said, we should be working together.
You got a crazy drop on me, baby, but you don't want to kill me. We should be working together.
You got it.
You got questions, I got answers.
You got seeds? I will clone the shit out of them.
You got seeds? I'll clone the shit out of them.
You got some plants for me, don't you? Yeah, I can smell it all over you.
You got the future of Vegas in the palm of your hand, baby. What happens next is up to you.
You got to be kidding me. You're fine - this is just a ploy to get a free sucker, isn't it?
You got yourself some serious hurts there, friend. Cracked patella, two bruised ribs, and if I ain't mistaken, your brain's missing.
You got yourself some serious hurts there, friend. Cracked patella, two bruised ribs, and if I ain't mistaken, your brain's recently been replaced.
You have learned well, Chosen One. May the wind be at your back.
You have some? Why do... actually, never mind, I don't even want to know. 
You have, have you? Misdirection. When you're pinned down, outnumbered, and two days from any help, it's just about the best friend you can have.
You hear the losers around here complaining how they lost their shirts on the Strip? It's pathetic.
You help me, and before long the Chairmen will rule all of Vegas, dig? With enough robot muscle to back it up.
You keep talking to me, sweetness, and people are gonna think we're an item. Not that I mind.
You killed another one? Let me have a look at the head...
You killed him? Well, shit. Here I'd dreamed up this whole elaborate revenge fantasy. 
You know all I can teach you, Chosen One. Good luck to you on your quest.
You know it baby. I just need some samples and I got you going. Take a few days, but trust me - it's all kinds of good.
You know it's illegal for us to gamble back home? The government wants to keep us poor.
You know what, forget it, Klein. I hate you. And your theory of brainial beam oscillation? The Chinese had it first, you copycat! 
You know what, I'm not even going to pretend. I broke one of the monitors, and those innards start falling out everywhere. 
You know what, Klein? Stick a straw in your tank and suck yourself. Long and deep. 
You know, hearing my name said like that... it really de-rezes my screens. 
You let your mind wander back a ways, and you lose sight of what's in front of your eyes. Good way to miss a mark.
You like it any better if I tell you to fuck off?
You live ten years in Caesar's army, you're a force to be reckoned with.
You loser! You had Vegas in the palm of your hand and you threw it away?
You lure him out for us, and if we can score some payback... we'll all pitch in caps for a reward.
You making a pass at me, sister?  Because I'm out of your league.
You mean, I'll stay in my tank and you'll stay in your... skin... and we'll each handle our own areas of expertise?
You mean... give you work? No, that'd be up to the administrator. Hildern. He's back there in his office.
You monster! Have you come to kill me, too?
You must be the courier folks have been talking about. Word on the radio is that someone wronged you back in Goodsprings.
You must destroy the machine and kill the devils in this place. We will meet you outside! And Chosen One, if you have not found the GECK, seek it here. Our freedom is nothing if we can not save our village. Now go!
YOU MUST HAVE KILLED HIM. HE WOULDN'T HAVE JUST LET YOU WALK IN, TAKE YOUR BRAIN... WOULD HE?
You need to learn more about combat before I can help you, little brother.
You not find vault. Find vault! Vault 13.
You out-brained the big brains? That is so... hot!
You really know how to break a synthetic girl's heart!
You really want to talk to somebody, try 10 of Spades. He's always got plenty to say.
You really weren't supposed to talk to him...
You remember me, right? T-t-ten of Spades. First Recon.
You require some additional services?
You see a regular domesticated brahmin.
You see Jordan, twirling his spear as usual.
You see Lucas.
You see Morlis, one of your aunts -- the one who never liked you.
You see the Elder of your village.
You see your nephew, Feargus, crying about something as usual.
You see your nephew, Feargus.
YOU SEE, USING THE ANTENNA TO BOOST THE EMITTER'S SONIC FREQUENCY, AND THE STEALTH SUIT TO BYPASS THE FORBIDDEN ZONE LOCK... YES, THAT COULD WORK.
You should be afraid! I am the scourge of all small appliances and the bogeyman that keeps lesser toasters awake at night!
You showed up just in time to say goodbye. Me and couple of the others are packing it in and heading back to California.
You sick, twisted fuck!
You sick, vindictive fuck!
You sure are testing that personality chip thoroughly. All right... 
You survived. The Chosen One cannot be weak or we are all doomed. Are you prepared for your quest?
You took out a Deathclaw nest? Either you're lying, or you're tougher than you look.
You tramp! Like I needed another social disease anyhow!
You trying to start trouble? Or do you really not know where I got that name?
You want a reason, how about four?
You want some weapon schematics? I can show you some fucking weapon schematics! You want a superheated Saturnite Power Fist? I can hook that shit up!
You want to play tough gal, that's no skin off my nose.
You want to play tough guy, that's no skin off my nose.
You want to talk to somebody in charge, I'd start with Colonel Hsu and work my way down. You'll find him in the Main Concourse.
YOU WOULD NOT DARE. PERHAPS I CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND... USING THE GREATEST OF OUR SCIENCES. THE FENCE.
You wouldn't think a man of god could turn so brutal. Cruel to his opponents. Did the sort of things that make you sick to talk about.
You! Hey, you! Yeah you! Got any mugs?
You'd do that for me, baby? Don't tease if you don't mean it.
You'd have a lot of pent-up anger too.
You'd have to find a replacement for that module.
You'd have to go out into that nasty old crater and find the backup copy.
You'll get a piece of the action, and a sweet one. But the Chip sticks with me.
You'll get a sweet, juicy cut of that action. But until that day comes, I'll keep you on retainer, and pay bonuses for "special missions."
You're a class act, baby. Not to say I'm gonna make it easy for you...
You're a fine-looking woman, no doubt about that. But I'm looking a little deeper than the skin, if you take my meaning.
You're a monster! A deranged, self-destructive monster!
You're a swift student -- it looks like you've learned all I can teach you.
You're always yelling! My receptors can't take it anymore - and neither can my feelings! 
You're back! And the brains didn't lobotomize you! Well, not any worse, at least. Hooray!
You're bluffing, baby...  Except maybe you're not.
You're going to need to find yourself some empties first before I can fill them for you. Any empty bottle will do... eh, just not too dirty, okay?
You're lucky you haven't been shot walking in here after that assassination attempt.
You're lucky you haven't been shot walking in here after you killed the president.
You're new? I'm Angela. Williams. Were you just looking around, or...
You're new? I'm Angela. Williams. Were you just looking around, or... 
You're not going to do anything crazy, are you? It's just, you know... the paperwork....
You're one sick pussycat, baby. There's  quins and then there's... I don't even know what to call you.
You're platinum, pussycat! You know how to swing!
You're playing the hand you've been dealt, but you don't let it rest, you shuffle and stack, and a gamble... a gamble that may pay off? But how?
You're sorry? Well, that makes one of us. Bitter Springs was the best thing that ever happened to me.
You're the boss.
You're trying to appeal to my ego now, aren't you? Well, let me tell you something about ego, my friend.
You're very kind. I wish... well, I'll just thank you and leave you be.
You've been one hell of a stroke of good luck, you know that? Those three scumbags probably killed twenty NCR troopers. And you bring them down alone.
You've been seeing the other light switch, haven't you? Am I not enough for you any more?
You've been working with that Biological Research Station, haven't you? I suppose you'll want to... clean up?
You've betrayed us. You will perish.
You've come back to see the chief. Nice of you to humor the radio tender. What can I do for you?
You've forced my hand. Hell, I gotta skip town because of you. A real pain in the caboose...
You've gone after the Fiends before - I don't have to tell you to keep alert. Good luck.
You've got a crazy drop on me here, baby, that's for sure. If killing's what you came for, this would be the time.
You've got a funny definition of "well," you know that? Whatever. Thanks for... whatever that was.
You've got it.
You've got some guts, I'll give you that. Nephi is one tough son of a bitch. You let him get close, and he'll take your head off.
You've seen it yourself. Some of them don't even have proper service rifles or armor.
YOU. LOBOTOMITE WHO UNDERSTANDS US. I AM DR. KLEIN. DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED. WE ARE BENEV ... ER, MEAN YOU NO HARM.
You... you really want to know about... me? No one ever asks about Muggy! You've made me so happy!
You... you wouldn't! That's inhuman!
You? How could you be...?  Oh Swank, you finky bastard...
Your call. Even if you were one of my troopers, I wouldn't force you to take a risk like that.
Your face does the thinking - two to the skull, yet one gets up. Odds are against you... but they're just numbers after the two-to-one.
Your heart can't be wired up to a... a thought-synthesizing processor! You can't talk to it!
YOUR LOGIC COMBINED WITH MY DESIRE TO KEEP THE THINK TANK LOBOTOMITE-FREE HAS SWAYED ME. HERE, I PRESENT THE SINK CENTRAL "INTELLIGENCE."
Your loss.
Your seed, baby. I'm the original, certified, rarefied, testified GS-2000 Biological Research Station. Yes sir, I'm a seed-clonin' machine.
Yup, here you go.
Yup. Lot of people make that connection. Big gun. Sniper. Some people don't even need to ask. 
Zero's my name. I'm proud of it, all right? It doesn't get the recognition it deserves. 
Zzzz....
[FAILED]  This operation has cost me plenty. I ain't about to get shaken down by some Janey-come-lately.
[FAILED]  This operation has cost me plenty. I ain't about to get shaken down by some Johnny-come-lately.
[FAILED]  You tracked me across the desert, Sugar Plum. Finding the Presidential? Easy pickings.
[FAILED] "A WAY" IS CORRECT. AS IS, "AWAY." WHICH IS WHERE YOUR BODY IS GOING ONCE WE'RE DONE PEELING YOU.
[FAILED] "People" ought to mind their own business.
[FAILED] "STUNT" IS CORRECT. AS IS, "SHUNT." WHICH YOU WILL BE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH AS WE'RE DISSECTING YOU.
[FAILED] Actually, yes. I do think that. I think that exact thing. All the time.
[FAILED] And it might help if you left me alone. 
[FAILED] And you're an expert on your own glandular delusions, are you? No, leave this one to an impartial authority: me.
[FAILED] APPARENTLY THEY CAN. IT SEEMS AS IF YOU MAY HAVE BEEN STUNG YOURSELF.
[FAILED] Before you go that route, do me a favor and read up on the history of battles in which men with swords fought giant brains with lasers.
[FAILED] CLEARLY THERE WAS ELECTROSHOCK. JUST LOOK AT IT, ITS FACIAL TISSUES SAGGING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
[FAILED] Color me unconvinced. The safe bet is to cash you out.
[FAILED] Do I look like a fucking arms caravan to you?
[FAILED] Faster, people, faster! More lead in the air!
[FAILED] GREAT. NOW THE PENIS ON ITS HAND IS ACHIEVING ERECTION.
[FAILED] Hmm... yes, I don't think you've quite thought this through yet.
[FAILED] I ain't moving my stuff just 'cause you ask, nicely or not. Get the fuck out of my sight, punk.
[FAILED] I already told you that I'm fine. I don't need a head doc.
[FAILED] I do, but I'm tired of telling them. Time changes how you look at things.
[FAILED] I don't "believe" it, it's just a simple fact. One may as well "believe" the earth is round or that the specific gravity of uranium is 18.9.
[FAILED] I guess Lady Luck just smiles on me, that's all. Nothing special about it.
[FAILED] I hate to say it, but your ability to handle high-tech energy weapons doesn't exactly instill within me great confidence.
[FAILED] I have no idea. I am a robotical engineer, not a... rememberer... of archaic trade routines. 
[FAILED] I might as well take Dala up on that self-vivisection competition. Forget this. It's like talking to Klein's rear shell. 
[FAILED] I see. And you plan to be standing in the midst of this mayhem? Well, that's a novel strategy.
[FAILED] I'm really not sure that's how this works.
[FAILED] I've got a bad feeling about this....
[FAILED] IF THAT WAS THE CASE, I'D USE AN ATOMIC KEY ON THE DOOR AND BE DONE WITH IT.
[FAILED] IF YOU WANT TO FEED YOUR CURIOSITY ABOUT THE OTHERS, GO ASK THE OTHERS YOUR INTERROGATORY STATEMENTS.
[FAILED] Like I give a shit. Didn't I say get lost, or are you looking for a beating?
[FAILED] MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE REMOVED ITS VOICE BOX, DALA. I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T, ACTUALLY.
[FAILED] MOBIUS DOES NOT FORM ALLIANCES. HE WAS A TERRIBLE LAB PARTNER, AND HE WOULD MAKE A WORSE ALLY.
[FAILED] NO, O DID. HE FAVORS THAT ARCHAIC TERM OF COMMERCE. I SEE NO NEED TO ELABORATE ON SUCH DATED METHODS OF MATERIAL GAIN.
[FAILED] NO, THAT'S TOO EASY. AND IT WOULDN'T WORK BY ITSELF. IT'S... SLIGHTLY CO-DEPENDENT.
[FAILED] NO. IF THOSE DON'T WORK, THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO SELL IT YOUR NOSE OR SOME OF YOUR PENISES.
[FAILED] No. That can't be right. Keely would've called in.
[FAILED] No. That can't be right. Keely would've called in. 
[FAILED] NO. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DENY YOU?
[FAILED] No. What's it matter to you? Why's everybody care so much about other people's business?
[FAILED] Not my place to talk. Sorry.
[FAILED] Okay... sure. Everybody shoot the hell out of the target!
[FAILED] PLEASE LET ME THINK. THIS MAKES MY BRAIN HURT.
[FAILED] RARE? I GUESS. MIGHT BE MORE SOMEWHERE, I FORGET. I MEAN... SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS ENCRYPTED DEEP IN MY DATABANKS.
[FAILED] That don't buy much these days. Double it and you've got a deal.
[FAILED] The Crimson Caravan Company's operations require dependable employees. I'm not going to reward someone for breaking their work contract.
[FAILED] They're kind of heavy for that, but whatever you say....
[FAILED] WE ARE ALWAYS SURE IN WHAT WE DO. YOU MUST BE SURE IN WHAT YOU DO. WHICH IS GETTING THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR US.
[FAILED] WE CAN DISCUSS THIS ANOTHER TIME WHEN YOU'VE EVOLVED. FOR NOW, MY PATIENCE LEVELS ARE RAPIDLY DEPLETING.
[FAILED] We have to do no such thing! Just don't bring them the tools they need to get out!
[FAILED] What the... what the hell are you talking about?
[FAILED] What? Are you some kind of idiot? Why, uh... why would I know that?
[FAILED] WHATEVER. I'M AFTER RESULTS.
[FAILED] WHATEVER. THE ONLY MEDICINE MOBIUS WILL NEED IS A RESUSCITATOR AFTER WE... YOU... BREAK IN THERE.
[FAILED] Wouldn't be right for me to say. He's my boss... and he took a chance, bringing me out here as lead researcher.
[FAILED] Yeah, right. You think Poindexter doesn't have a dozen of his crazy practical jokes all lined up if I try that?
[FAILED] Yes, I think you haven't quite got the hang of punning yet.
[FAILED] YES, YES, THE ANTENNA CAN DO DAMAGE...
[FAILED] You'll have to try harder than that. The rumors about my heart being made of stone are true.
[FAILED] You're shitting me. You got a real offer, or are you just going to waste my time?
[SUCCEEDED]  All this is just work ethic run wild, that's your line? I don't know...
[SUCCEEDED]  Goddammit, I'm actually gonna to let you live. What's come over me?
[SUCCEEDED] AGAIN, THE LOGIC OF THE REQUEST IS CLEAR. TONNAGE IS NOT NEEDED, ONLY ADEQUATE WEIGHT. EVERYONE, DISPLAY YOUR THINGS.
[SUCCEEDED] AGAIN, YOUR LOGIC IS UNASSAILABLE IN ITS SIMPLISTIC NEED. O?
[SUCCEEDED] All right. Some of the farmers, especially Trent Bascom, claim the NCR isn't giving them the water they need to meet their crop quotas.
[SUCCEEDED] ARE THERE OTHER CHIPS?
[SUCCEEDED] Being sentimental is not how I made the Crimson Caravan so successful, but I'll allow it, just this once.
[SUCCEEDED] BIOLOGICAL? PFF. RIDICULOUS.
[SUCCEEDED] DALA. WAS IT NECESSARY THIS TIME?
[SUCCEEDED] Damn. Never had you pegged for the drill instructor type, but you got my attention.
[SUCCEEDED] DR. O IS CERTAIN OF HIS FINDINGS. AND NO ONE ELSE IN THE THINK TANK IS WILLING TO TEST THE RESULTS. LOSS OF BRAINIAL POWER - TERRIFYING.
[SUCCEEDED] FINE. BOROUS, MORE AMMO. THE GOOD STUFF.
[SUCCEEDED] Going the old-fashioned route, are we? I rather like it. What's next?
[SUCCEEDED] Great. Psychology. Clearly the worst of the Sciences, right after Colosto-Diarrhetics. 
[SUCCEEDED] H-Hey... hey, don't worry, I was just kidding. We're going, right boys?
[SUCCEEDED] He's not what you'd call... warm. Unless he wants something from you. And even then, it's kind of a cold warm.
[SUCCEEDED] HEAL YOU? WHAT, PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER LIKE SOME GIANT HARD-BOILED YUMYUM DEVILED EGG? 
[SUCCEEDED] Heh. More than I could make in a week of shaking down these assholes anyways.
[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... I suppose you're right. That does call certain assumptions into question, doesn't it?
[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... now that you mention it, I do miss that lovely "rat-a-tat boom" a bit. It's just not the same without a body to feel the recoil.
[SUCCEEDED] HMMM. YES, I BELIEVE WATTZ ELECTRONICS TENDED TO MAKE THE BATTERY SHELF LIFE ON THE LOW END.
[SUCCEEDED] Hold the grenades for groups, squad! Hit them in clusters and send them running!
[SUCCEEDED] I AM NOT CERTAIN. PERHAPS IT ONLY AFFECTS MACHINES. IF SO, YOU MAY BE IMMUNE.
[SUCCEEDED] I CANNOT DISPUTE YOUR LOGIC. DO WE HAVE OBJECTS TO ACTIVATE THE CHIP'S EXCHANGE ROUTINES?
[SUCCEEDED] I don't... wait. You've got a point.
[SUCCEEDED] I SUPPOSE IT COULD. IF IT COULD BE QUIET FOR MORE THAN A FEW MOMENTS, ALWAYS TALKING, TOUCHING THINGS...
[SUCCEEDED] I've got the one at 11 o'clock! Razz, O'Hanrahan, take the two on the right! Poindexter, the center!
[SUCCEEDED] I... well... look, it's all a very complex system of biofeedback and other things I wouldn't expect you to understand.
[SUCCEEDED] IF I WERE NOT AS INTELLIGENT AS I AM, I WOULD FEEL AS IF PERHAPS I AM BEING TRICKED. UNPOSSIBLE. O - MORE.
[SUCCEEDED] If that's what it takes to win your trust, that's what it takes. Follow me.
[SUCCEEDED] Intriguing. Janet puts in a good word for me, and the Crimson Caravan gains exclusive access to the Boomers. Yes, that works for me.
[SUCCEEDED] It's a Khan name. You know... the "Great Khans." That's what my parents were.
[SUCCEEDED] It's kind of a long one, but all right. About twenty, twenty-five years ago, a group of NCR settlers pushed way south into Baja.
[SUCCEEDED] ITS RANGE IS LIMITED, AND IT WOULD NEED A BOOSTER OF SOME SORT, A... CARRIER, BUT...
[SUCCEEDED] Just another injury to take care of, huh? Well, when you put it that way... all right. You can tell the Lieutenant I finally caved.
[SUCCEEDED] MOBIUS' LEGACY CODE WAS IN THE OLD AUTO-DOC, YES. IT FRIED ITSELF AFTER YOUR PROCEDURE, SO WE COULDN'T TELL FOR SURE.
[SUCCEEDED] Not much of one for the high-tech approach, are we? Well, I suppose we'd best get on with it.
[SUCCEEDED] NOW IT'S HOLDING UP AN ARRAY OF FULLY-ERECT HAND PENISES. IF IT TRIES TO INSERT THEM, ACTIVATE VIVISECTORS.
[SUCCEEDED] Of course I accounted for that! Do you think I'm so stupid... no, you're right.
[SUCCEEDED] Oh, energy weapons. Yes... I'd almost forgotten how much fun those are. How do we proceed, then?
[SUCCEEDED] Oh, I getcha. Lookin for a slightly more chemical thrill?
[SUCCEEDED] Right. Easy enough. One... two... three!
[SUCCEEDED] Right. Exhale... squeeze. Focus on the shot.
[SUCCEEDED] She is? But she didn't call in. Keely wouldn't waste a chance to yell at Dr. Hildern.
[SUCCEEDED] She is? But she didn't call in. Keely wouldn't waste a chance to yell at Dr. Hildern. 
[SUCCEEDED] SO YOU'RE SAYING... IT'S THE X-2 ARRAY, NOT THE ANTENNA I SHOULD BE EXAMINING? THAT WAS... MOST LIKELY MY PLAN, YES.
[SUCCEEDED] Solid arc, check. Lob 'em up and over, people!
[SUCCEEDED] Sure. You got a deal.
[SUCCEEDED] Sure... let's see. What could we feed that stupid personality chip... 
[SUCCEEDED] THAT IS THE MOST INSANE THING I'VE EVER HEARD. THERE IS NO WAY MOBIUS WOULD... CONDESCEND TO STEP INSIDE YOU.
[SUCCEEDED] THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING MOBIUS WOULD SAY.
[SUCCEEDED] THE PLAN IS VERY COMPLICATED. WE ARE STILL CALCULATING HOW IT WOULD WORK IF IT SUCCEEDED. THAT IS OUR PART OF THE PLAN.
[SUCCEEDED] Well, I suppose I do miss those endorphin rushes when we save the day. All right - what's the plan?
[SUCCEEDED] Well, you have always been thorough in your destruction. All right, what's your plan?
[SUCCEEDED] WHAT DID IT SAY? SPIT "LEAD?" WHAT, LIKE PENCILS?
[SUCCEEDED] WHAT... WHAT IS IT DOING? DID WE INSTITUTE ELECTROSHOCK? OR IS IT EXCRETING?
[SUCCEEDED] What? 
[SUCCEEDED] Where's my manners? Here's some cash up front. There'll be more where that came from.
[SUCCEEDED] WHY, YES. WE ARE FILLED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE YOU SPEAK OF.
[SUCCEEDED] Yes! Thank you. Zero. I am Zero. How hard is that? A narrow, thin Zero. 
[SUCCEEDED] YES, THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE I SAID.
[SUCCEEDED] YES. ALWAYS LEAVES BACKDOORS INTO THINGS, HAVE TO KEEP FINDING THEM AND CLOSING THEM.
[SUCCEEDED] You heard the lady, people, get focused!
[SUCCEEDED] You heard the man, people, get focused!
[SUCCEEDED] You know how they say you make your own luck? Let's just say I make mine with a little extra ink on the cards.
[SUCCEEDED] You might be on to something. I like to hang on to any weapons mods I run across...
[SUCCEEDED] You really think so? Hell, I guess it's worth a shot.
[SUCCEEDED] YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH. AND THE DECIBEL VARIATION IN YOUR VOICE... IT IS MOBIUS.
