You see Abel.
You see a large mutant.
You are not supposed to be here.
Hng.
Of course not. I'm here to kill you!
Why do you say that?
Oh, yeah? Your momma!
Pik!
I'm gonna kick yer ass if you say that again!
Pik! Pik!
Oh, you gonna get it now!
You human. Me mutant. Mutant kill human.
How can you do that? What about the force field?
Abel take care of that. Then Abel kick yer ass!
Children are not allowed here. This mutant place. Go away.
Hng!
I have to get through this force field. Please lower it.
No.
You again. Abel kick yer ass!
 tell me about name
Me Abel.
 tell me about generic
Hng.
Why do you say that?
You see an inhabitant of Adytown.
Looks like rain . . . as always.
Sorry, have to go. Got work to do.
We don't get many outsiders here.
Gotta get back to work.
I'd get back to the Hub, if I were you.
Good day . . . if that is what you can call it.
Yeah . . . whatever.
No time to talk.
Can't talk right now.
Hope the rain ain't glowin' like yesterday.
Looks like we're going to be short food again.
I hope the caravans pass by again soon.
We have a chance to make it now.
Adytum will be the town we want it to be.
Thank you for your help.
Thank you for getting rid of the Regulators.
Thank you for our freedom.
It is good that the Regulators are gone.
Welcome to the New Adytum.
You see a super mutant. He is guarding the airlock door.
You see a super mutant guard.
Jeremiah, you may pass.
Move along.
Move faster, messenger.
Normals cannot carry weapons here! Halt and identify yourself!
Grrr!
Uh, sorry. I'll put it away.
I'm just passing through. No need for identities here.
Die! Die! Die! I always wanted to say that.
I will not be spoken to that way. You will be punished.
Halt! What is your business here, 'child'.
Hng!
I'm, uh, doing stuff.
I'm on important business. You have no right to stop and question me.
Don't talk to me, big boy.
Your answer does not settle my nerves. Speak quickly and clearly, or I will assume you are here for foul purposes. I assure you that you will not like that...
Uh, no, really, honestly. I'm doing stuff.
I'm bringing a message to our leader.
I sense the untruth behind your words. You will not be allowed in. This I promise you...
You may pass, but next time, follow the proper procedure...
Ok, thanks. See you around.
And what's that?
Blessing to you, brother.
A true follower of the Master would have that knowledge. You are an intruder!
Move along. I don't have time for your questions.
You are annoying me.
I have work to do. Do you?
You are making a mistake by coming here. Explain yourself or perish...
Nuggie!
I have nothing to say.
I'm here to protect humanity from the likes of you.
Oh, shut up!
You should not try to fool me by playing dumb. I tire of this...
What kind of foolish bigotry is that, we are 'humanity.' We're just as human as you are.
What kind of crap is that?
There is no possible way that you are human.
My name is Kyle. I was born to a mother and a father, like yourself. The Master just oversaw my rebirth. These muscles, this skin, this strength does not make me any less human than you. I do not like all that the Unity stands for, but it is the best chance for peace that we have.
Not on my watch, it isn't. I'm here to put an end to you and your kind.
You may be human, but that still doesn't make your Unity right. I guess we will be enemies.
It is a pity that you act this way, but you will not proceed further...
It will be a true shame to see your head on a pike.
Intruders!
I no speak to you.
You gain 
 experience points for bluffing your way past the guards.
You see Mitch of the All-N-One store.
How may I help you today?
aI'd like to buy something.
bI'd like to sell something.
cNothing. Thanks.
dRunk.
Great. Here's what I have.
Great, always looking for new things.
Sorry, I can't understand you. Come back when you get more of a brain.
Thanks. Come again.
You see Jake the Arms Dealer.
You see Alya, a desert raider.
I am Alya of the Khans. How might I help you today?
aI'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Have you seen her?
bHow about a little kiss?
cWhy has your band of Raiders attacked Shady Sands?
dNo, thank you.
eHooroo!
If she is one of those women from Shady Sands, maybe you should look there. Now go, I need to finish sharpening my knives. 
aKiss this!
We do not attack those of Shady Sands. We are from the same place they are. It is only right that they share with us!
aBut you are hurting their livestock and terrifying them.
bThat seems fair to me.
cUh, yeah. I think I will be going now.
You sound just as wimpy as they are. Look, if they were in any trouble of starvation, then it is their own fault for not planning ahead. Consider what we do a trade in talents.
aA trade in talents?!? How can this be a trade in talents? You don't give them anything.
Sure, and chickens have three legs.
Uh, yeah. I think I will be going now.
I am sorry, but I can't understand you. I'm sharpening my knives and would not like to be bothered.
We give them the most important thing possible. We give their dreary lives excitement.
I don't think they want your type of excitement.
I think I will make their lives boring again. I'll start with you!
Uh, yeah. I think I will be going now.
I didn't ask. But since you obviously don't have any concept of fun, I think I will end your existence.
Mocking me does not bode well for you. I suggest you leave my presence.
Darn straight that it's fair. Now get out of my face.
I am busy right now preparing for our next raid.
You see Andrew, the jail guard.
Okay, you can go now.
Hey! You! Stop!
Can I help you?
Who are you?
What are you doing?
cNo thanks.
I'm Andrew. My job is to guard the jail.
I'm guarding the jail. I make sure that miscreants don't get in or out.
Why would you keep people from getting in the jail?
Oh.
You have a good day. And stay out of trouble.
Someone might leave something to help a prisoner escape. Or someone might get locked inside, and stuck until we could get the keys.
Eergh!
Move along, fella.
Move along, miss.
Hey! Knock it off!
You see Aradesh.
Greetings, wanderer. Please do not be offended if the gentlefolk about seem rude. As Dharma said, 'Tough times tan the human hide.' Your business in Shady Sands might be?
Greetings. Your business in Shady Sands might be?
bWe don't take to strangers much. Your business in Shady Sands?
I'm from a small village west of here. I'm just exploring and mean you no harm.
What's it to you?
My reasons are mine to keep.
I'm from a Vault to the west. My people are dying of thirst and I need to find a water purifier chip for them to survive.
I'm saving an entire people from destruction!
Shady Sands? Whoops, I'm lost! I'll just be going now.
Hunh?
I know of no village to the west.
Have you been through the mountains west of here?
So?
Are you saying you know every location from here to the ocean?
I'm sure you've been many places, but you must have missed my tiny village.
Ah well, to my regret, I have not. Which begs the question, how did you make that passage?
It was pretty tough, but I made it.
What's it to you?
Look, all I wanted was a few supplies and things, but I will gladly go elsewhere.
I don't need to answer you.
Yes, hmmm, yes, yes. yes. I shall believe you...for now. But we do not trust easily, especially those who might be dangerous. Know that Seth and I will be watching you.
It is my town, wanderer. You must answer my questions or leave. This is not a matter of choice.
I don't have to tell you anything.
I mean you no harm, really.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
You are quite insolent. I believe you should leave. Do not return. You will not be welcome.
So be it, wanderer. Seth will show you out.
You must think me quite gullible, wanderer. You conquered the mountains by yourself?
Doesn't matter how I think. It's true I came from the mountains.
No, just stupid.
As Dharma said, 'Caution is life in troubled times. Your origin is not the issue. Your intent is.
Okay.
AI will let you pass, but know this: Seth and I will watch you very, very closely. Do not even consider bringing trouble here.
And keep them you may. But this is not a city of open hospitality. If you desire that, go to Junktown. You may enter, but know we have our eyes on you.
A Vault. How shall I trust you, wanderer, when you are not honest with me?
No, honestly, I come from a Vault!
The Vault is . . . the name of my village.
You're right, I was lying.
Hmmm, yes, yes, yes. Then tell me of this Vault.
Well . . . the Vault is actually the name of my town. We name it that because it's in between two big cliffs.
It's a big place built into a mountain far to the west. My people have been there for the last  years.
Why do you want to know?
Wanderer, I shall believe you . . . for now. You may enter Shady Sands, but be warned your every move will be watched.
I will not be lied to, wanderer.
I don't have to tell you anything.
I mean you no harm, really.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Hmmm. You may enter. But stay out of trouble.
What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
What's going on around here?
Thanks. Bye.
Greetings again, young wanderer. I hope your stay here has been pleasant.
It's been great. Can I ask you some questions?
It has. I gotta run though.
If you like sewers.
Nuh-huh.
nGreetings. What may I help you with this fine day?
bIs there something you want?
Can you tell me about Shady Sands?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?
Nothing, really, I was just leaving.
Nuh-uh.
Certainly. What do you wish to know?
bYou may ask, but please hurry. There are more important uses for my time.
What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
What's going on around here?
Thanks. Bye.
gAh. Happy journeys, wanderer.
nGoodbye.
bI certainly hope so.
Dharma said, 'A man and his wayward tongue are soon parted.' Come back when you have learned some manners.
That is quite enough, wanderer. Seth will show you out of the city. Do not return. Your welcome will not be pleasant.
gShady Sands is much like a family, one that keeps to itself.
bWe are a very protective community. As Dharma said, 'Many sticks can be broken. A bundle cannot.'
What kind of things do you have around here?
Interesting. Are there any other cities around here?
How cute. Well, I better be going.
The Gardens are on the south side. The Brahma Pens are north, although the smell is, I fear, quite intense this time of year.
Anything else?
aWe are small and self sufficient so there is little else to tell.
Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?
Thanks. Bye.
bIt is a small place. You have feet.
Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?
bDharma said, 'Heed not the call of the wolf when the fox is raiding the hen house.'
gJunktown lies south of here, though there is little in the way of visitation. From stories, I'm certain there are cities south of that.
Thanks. I . . . Can I ask you a few more questions?
It is a quiet time, thankfully.
Sounds . . . boring
Well, then, can I ask you a few more questions?
Good. Hopefully it will stay that way for a while.
Yes. We like it that way.
What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
What's going on around here?
Thanks. Bye.
Oh my yes. Great packs of Rad Scorpions are killing our herds. We don't know where they're from, and no matter how many we kill, there's always more!
Go on.
aAnd now the monsters are attacking my people! Razlo is trying to find a cure for their poison, but I'm not sure how it goes.
Well, I'll help you get rid of these things!
I can help you for a price.
That's terrible. Can I ask you a few more questions?
Ummm, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Please talk to Razlo. He possesses far more information on these creatures than I.
As Dharma said, 'Those who tend their own flock, know the shepherd.'
I know it's hard for you to trust, but I would like to help.
Your choice. Can I ask you some more questions?
aPlease hurry and rid us of those Rad Scorpions!
Things are much more settled now. Razlo has been working on a cure for Rad Scorpion poison, and with that, we should be able to fight what's left of them.
It was nothing. Can I ask you some more questions?
You don't need to worry anymore. I destroyed the Nest.
You are truly a hero! Know that the people of Shady
Sands are most grateful.
Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions, though?
Thanks. Bye!
If you can understand me, please try to find my daughter.
Since you brought my Tandi back to me, things are quite fine. My eternal gratitude to you, wanderer.
What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
What's going on around here?
Thanks. Bye.
Yes, yes. Umm. Have a good stay.
Ahh, wanderer. How goes the search for my daughter?
Sorry, but I haven't found her. I will, though.
I'm sorry, but she is dead.
Duh-nada.
Sorry, but I haven't found her. I will, though.
Slow, but I am making some progress. Can I ask you a few more questions?
Guunngggg!
aThank you for trying. Please leave me to my grief.
May my thoughts be wings to your feet. Please hurry.
Thank goodness you came! I am in desperate need of assistance. My daughter, Tandi, is missing. I do not know what to do!
Have you tried to save her?
Uhh?
aMy people are not skilled in this. Already three patrols have gone out to look, but none returned. Will you help me?
Okay. Who could have taken her?
I'll do it . . . for a fee.
I am sorry, but I have other things I have to do.
Seth and I believe one of the raider clans is responsible - retribution for our resistance to them. Take this spear. It was found where my daughter was last seen.
Okay, I'll check it out.
APlease, talk to Seth. He knows much about these raiders. And God speed, wanderer.
Of course, I will reward you. Bring her and you will receive  in Hub Script. Will you help me?
Okay. Who could have taken her?
Ah . . . no thanks. I got other stuff I gotta take care of.
As Dharma said, 'While you are out hunting the wolves, do not bring the lion to your den.' If you will not help, you must leave here.
I will be forever in your debt for your courage and bravery, wanderer. Here is your reward.
Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions, first?
Thanks.
Until we meet again, my friend. May the water you find in the desert not shine at you in the dark.
What are you doing? Put that back at once!
That is not yours. Please do not take it.
Stop that at once!
What are you doing here? I am resting, come back in the morning!
I am he. I lead this humble town of Shady Sands.
ADharma was a great, religious man. You would do well to listen closely to his sayings.
She is my daughter. It is she that makes this hard life worth living.
Hmm, yes, yes. Razlo is our doctor. If it ails you, he can heal it. I would wager he is just a little north of here at this moment.
A fine young man, Seth. Captain of our guards. He is likely to be at the Guard House. 
A wonderful woman. She just celebrated her sixtieth birthday! She spends much time with Razlo, talking his ear off with her veritable treasure trove of stories.
Ummm, um, um. Very bad. There are two bands of raiders that we know of. They call themselves the Vipers and the Khans.
Be very careful with such as these. Raiders who are fanatically religious can be quite dangerous. No one here knows of their base.
Umm, yes, yes. The Khans are nastier then the Vipers, let me tell you. These barbarians attack from the southeast.
Mean creatures, they are. Be careful of their tail.
Their poison can be lethal if not looked after.
Yes, yes. yes. It is a rumor of a monster created during the War.
Junktown is south or here. Their merchants occasionally come to trade, but not often.
The Vipers and Khans both use spears. We know this from their attacks.
You will find it at the front of town. Seth will likely be there.
No one knows for certain, but the packs seem to be coming from the northeast.
I don't know.
I can't really say I have heard of that.
Hm, no. No, I have not heard of that.
As I said . . .
Like I mentioned earlier . . .
Like I said . . .
As I had told you before . . .
I shall not repeat myself so often as to make myself sound stupid. Please listen next time.
I will not stand here like a sputtering candle simply because you cannot listen.
Go talk to Seth about that. He'll know more than I.

I will not waste my time on treacherous outsiders.
 tell me about generic responses
I don't know.
I can't really say I have heard of that.
Hm, no. No, I have not heard of that.

You see damaged Power Armor.
You cannot use this until it is repaired.

It is obvious that you do not yet have the skill to repair this.
You repair the armor.
That does nothing.
You fail to repair the armor.
You gain 
experience points for repairing the power armor.
Kalnor, a Junktown guard.
You'd better watch yourself here.
This isn't a good town to get in trouble in.
Behave, and we won't have to get nasty.
You're OK.
Keep up the good work.
Nice day, isn't it?
This is Junktown. Nice place to live, as long as you stay on our good side.
Watch out for Gizmo and his cronies.
I like my boss.
You'd better put that away. Junktown is a friendly place, friend, and we want to keep it that way.
Put what away?
Don't tell me what to do, loser boy.
Sounds fair. By the way, what is the local law regarding weapons?
Uh, oh.
Your weapon, idiot. Killian won't take your arms away, but you'd better damn well keep them in your holster.
Oh, sorry.
No way! I'm not putting down my shooters for nobody!
You'd better behave, since it's the law, and I enforce the law. Put your weapon away. Don't draw it unless in self-defense and you won't have a problem with us guards. Disobey the law and we will return you to the lawless wasteland--dead or alive.
Sure, since you put it that way.
Bite your laws!
Well, uh, fine with me. But you'd better be careful.
Good you asked. No weapons can be drawn except in self-defense. If you start a fight, it's your fault. Other than that, it's your right to go around armed. Just don't pull a knife or gun without just cause. Have a good day.
Hey you, no weapons! And I don't care if your momma dropped you on our head as a kid. No weapons.
Hey! You! What are you doing sneaking around?
Nothing.
I'm not sneaking around. I just like to walk cautiously.
Uhhh.
Whatever you're doing, don't do it in this town.
Hey! No shady characters in town! Get out of here before we throw you out!
Well, uh, OK. Whatever. Just don't do anything out of line.
Thanks, bye.
Certainly. I will throw caution to the wind, sir.
Certainly. I will throw caution to the wind, ma'am.
You'd better watch your step around here, because we'll be watching you.
Welcome to Junktown. What can I do for you?
Nothing, thanks.
What are you doing here? What is this place?
Where can I get some supplies?
Wa-wa!
I dunno about that. You might want to check with Killian. He's to the north. That's up that way, OK?
What does it look like? I'm a guard, and I'm keeping an eye out for strangers like you. And this place is called Junktown. Hey, don't laugh. I happen to like the name myself. We mostly do trading. Sometimes we trade with those stuck up bastards from Hub. Hey, you're not from the Hub are you?
What? The Hub? Sure I am!
Me? No, I'm not from the Hub.
Then you must know most of the rules. Have a good day. And I am sorry about the bastards part, OK?
Yeah! Hey, no problem. Bye.
It's going to cause me some severe mental trauma. Later.
Hmmm. OK. It's not our place to ask questions. Have a good day and don't make any trouble.
Oh, heck. The place for that is Darkwater's. Killian runs it. It's a little to the north. Killian has the best supplies in town.
Thanks. Bye.
You wanna show me where you keep "your" supplies?
Uh, no. Sorry, lady. I got work to do here.
Have a nice day.
Keep out of trouble.
Boy, I sure hope my replacement gets here soon. It feels like I've been standing guard duty forever.
I'm sorry, the gates are closed for the night. Come back in the morning.
Hey, I need to get in!
No problem. See you in the morning.
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but I would like to enter your town. You can see that I would cause no harm.
Hunh-huh!
Come . . . back . . . day . . .
Sorry, the rules are the rules. No strangers admitted during the night.
Well, I shouldn't do this, but you seem like a nice enough person. Come on in, but don't make any trouble.
Hey! It's you! Come on in, 
. Good to see you again!
Hey, you'd better turn right around and walk back out of here.
Go on in.
Hey buddy, can you spare some change?
I'm tryin' to drink here!
I don't feel so good.
Man, I gotta get some work.
Could you pass the peanuts?
Not drunk enough . . .

Sorry man, but you passed the point of no return with us. Time to slam off!
Sorry woman, but you passed the point of no return with us. Time to slam off!
Why would I want to talk with someone who goes around killing kids? Get out of my face!
I hear you're pretty tough. But tough don't impress Ton. You got something to say or you wanna get it on? Let's do it!
Peace, brother! I'm just checking the place out.
I'm not interested in impressing you. You got something intelligent to say, say it!
Get it on? Mister, I don't go for scrawny little boys.
What do you want?
You talk too much.
You wanna die, and I wanna kill someone. Works for me.
Waa!
Man, I already talked to you! Take your shit somewhere else!
boy
girl
Hey, you think your weapon's gonna earn you some 'spect? It's gonna earn you a grave, man. Put it away.
Hey, you think your weapon's gonna earn you some 'spect? It's gonna earn you a grave, girl. Put it away.
What do you want, you stupid zombie? Get outta my face before I break it.
I was looking for someone smart enough to tell me what's really going on around this joint!
What will the priests say if they hear you talking like this?
Any time, pal. I've been waiting for a good scrap!
Hey, what's the problem? A few drinks and we'll be buds!
Did you know that even a child can apply enough pressure to the right spot in your kneecap to cripple you for life? Just thought you'd want to know.
You wanna talk to Ton? Fine. But if I hear the word "praise," I'll kill you.
You're not a big fan of worship services?
What's your problem, pal?
I want to speak with the man in charge.
Sure thing. The only thing I feel like praising is a bottle of Rad Scorpion.
Fine. The first one of us who says that word dies. Bargain?
Hello, miss. I am Ton, , pounds of the Master's toughest fighter. I have also been evolved by the FEV into something that you need to check out. Let's get it on, baby.
No way in hell.
That's a little too fast. Let's get to know each other first.
Hello. I've been evolved by the FEV so that anyone that annoys me dies. Stop annoying me, little man.
Check it out somewhere else. Ton don't like your company.
Fine. You want to play it straight? Sometimes killing's necessary. Sometimes I even like it. But I hear you love killing . . . all the time. Every time I've met a psycho, either he dies, or Ton dies. Ton is still here. So why don't you go elsewhere.
Man, I could learn to like you. You're either an incredible asshole, or you got guts. Either way is fine with Ton, as long as you don't jam me up. You want to join up?
Whatever happened to peace and love?
What's involved?
No way in hell, pal.
I'll jam whatever I want, wherever I want. So let's kick out the jams!
To see you suffer. Let's go, hombre, give me what I want.
Beware of what you want. You may not like what you get.
I'd rather be your friend.
You aren't worth my time.
Go ahead. Make the first move. The last one's mine.
Fine. Talking's over. Make your move.
I just wanted to talk.
You're dead . . .
Shit! You're dumber than the zombies! Just get out of here!
The Master wants peace, and he wants us to get it for him, so we're going to have fun. Capiche?
Yeah, but there's got to be more going on than just that.
Does the Master really want peace or does he just want killing?
Who is this Master?
Sounds good to me.
Screw the Master! Let's kill them all!
It's not healthy to ask the wrong question, compadre. They have all the answers they want you to hear. People who ask the wrong questions, or people who screw up, well, they don't stay around here very long.
I do my job. They like it when I do my job. They like it when street trash and Followers stop breathing. It lets the Nightkin do other things. Don't mess with me . . . it ain't healthy.
What are you doing dressed like a zombie? If you got the 'tude, you gotta let it show!
I don't care about the clothes, man. I just want to know what's going on here!
They don't bother you as much if you don't look like they might want to convert you.
None of your business, pal.
I've been thinking of converting.
It ain't 'tude. It's a way of death.
We don't drink in here. Nightkin don't like it. You better get a few more clues before you talk to Ton again.
You're crazy! I could almost like you, except that I have the feeling that people who hang around you don't live long. Get the hell out of here.
You stand around this for months and you go crazy as them. What do you want from Ton?
How'd these people get like this?
I want sex and violence, without the sex. You know where I can get it?
I am losing it in this zombie pit, and I don't need you helping me. Get the hell away from me.
That's Morpheus. He stays upstairs, except to give sermons. He don't even do that much anymore. He's smart and he's a winner, and that's all that counts. Go see him for yourself.
You need to go out into the Boneyard, pal. Ain't no slosh in here, and I've looked!
Agree. What can Ton do for you?
Bitch! You don't know what you're missing! Get out!
Life is too short for that. Let me show you why you don't want to wait.
But I want someone who knows what's going on.
No thank you. But I wouldn't mind being friends.
Get lost, you piece of trash.
Sure.
Life IS shorter than you think. Die, asshole!
I'm not LITTLE, bitch!
Who believes in that bullshit? They have to program these morons to believe in that stuff anyway.
How did it happen?
Really?
What a bunch of losers.
Tell me more about your posse.
Okay, I'll join up.
Someone should put them out of their misery. Like me . . .
When we get the word, we go out and kill people. People like the Followers or some of the more dangerous gang types.
So the Followers are a problem?
This sounds pretty sick to me.
Who needs the word? Why not just kill them?
Fine. Do what you want. But I'd get out before it becomes unhealthy around here.
You annoying little piece of shit. You're worse than a Junktowner, you coward. Get the hell out.
What else is there to know? I get to eat well, sleep in peace and kill some of the people who used to screw me over. You want something more from life?
Who knows? Who cares? I get to eat well, sleep in peace and kill some of the people who used to screw me over. You want something more from life?
Hmmm, Ton never thought of that. But if they bother me too much, I break their face. Then they stop bothering Ton. What do you want?
Converting? Well, good luck. You'll need it.
Why would I need luck?
That doesn't sound good.
Thanks. You're a true friend.
I don't need luck as long as I've got ammo.
These people, these zombies, weren't always like this. I could even stand a few of them. Then they got converted. Some of them came out like this. Some of them didn't come out at all. Ton doesn't like it, but these people pay Ton well.
Why do you keep jumping between first and third person?
Tell me more about the conversion process.
Did you go through the conversion process?
This place is strictly low-rent.
Really, how much?
Nobody's gonna do this to me!
You talk to Morpheus or to Lasher, or you can bother Ton, and Ton give you more violence than you can handle.
Well baby, what's going on is that there are a lot of zombies chanting, a lot of people dying and the Children are going to take over everything. And there's you and me and nothing else matters!
But Barracas, darling, surely there's more going on than that . . .
Oh, Ton!
Forget it, creep. You ain't my type.
Nothing else matters? Hell no! I wanna hear about the dying part!
Unfortunately, this is the worst place on earth to experience what Ton does best. Too many zombies cramp my style. I'll let you know when I think about some place more convenient . . .
You'll find out soon enough what happens upstairs. If you tough, you get through it fine. It happened to Ton, and Ton is just fine!
Uh . . . I didn't say anything. You forget what Ton told you or Ton will make you forget, permanently!
They used to be whiners. But Ton talks too much. You get out of my face.
Fine. You stay low-profile until I give you the word. Then we have fun.
They're cowards. They set ambushes against our patrols. They send spies and saboteurs. They know they can't win a real fight. The Master says we should feel sorry for them, but Ton just want to kill them. Smart man, Ton.
We need discipline, fool! We're soldiers now! We obey orders. Killers die, but soldiers win their battles. We're going to beat the Followers. We're going to beat EVERYONE!
Who the hell knows? Maybe it's just Morpheus pulling the strings. Things are good, and if this dries up, Ton goes somewhere else.
Well, don't get too eager. Even with the Nightkin, it's still tough fighting. But if we play it smart, we get out ahead. That's the only thing Ton cares about.
The conversion isn't easy. You see these people, all these zombies? They used to be like you and me. Ton survived. These people didn't. But why should Ton care about you?
You don't like the way Ton talk? Then Ton kill you!
Ton go through it fine. I . . . uh . . . I . . . uh . . . Ton . . . Ton just fine.
I used to be with the Dead Dog gang. Always hungry, always tired. This place is much better for Ton. Why should I worry about anyone else? Nobody ever worry about me.
You greedy asshole! Get outta here before Ton kills you!
Then get out of here now, before it's too late.
Nothing important as you and me. Unfortunately, this is the worst place on earth to experience what Ton does best. Too many zombies cramp my style. I'll let you know when I think about some place more convenient . . .
Why you manipulative bitch! Nobody screws with Ton like that!
You have enraged Barry!
You see Barry.
Hey! Only ghouls get a water ration.
I'm gonna get you for waking me up!
The mutant ignores you.
I dunno.
Yer standin in it.
He's a wus. We should just wipe out him and his ghouls.
That's here.
I dunno.
He Harry's boss.
Wimpy things.
Wimpier than ghouls.
You see Billy.
Hi there.
Hi, what are you doing?
Can I have a brahmin?
Hi. Uh, bye.
Arg!
Ta.
Why would you want a brahmin? Do you have a Caravan? Well, it doesn't matter. I only take care of them. Dan is the one that owns them; he won't sell them though.
Why?
I was just kidding.
Cuz of all the missing caravans. He doesn't have any to spare, the caravans use most of them. The others are sold for food. Well, I better stop talking; Dan will get mad if he sees me talking to a stranger.
Oh, okay.
Nothing . . . I mean, I'm taking care of the brahmin.
What's the spear for? Are they dangerous?
What's a brahmin?
What's a brahmin? You must be joking. Why they're one of the major food sources and forms of transportation around here. They haul the caravans. Dan says this is a really important job, but it's the Bone.
Oh, I knew that!
Dan's right. You are doing a great job.
Yea, it looks that way. Have fun.
Hey, you're one of those skags aren't you?
Really? You think so? Gee, thanks.
You're not from around here, are you? I'll give you one tip: Don't get caught stealing!
Sure, thanks.
I wouldn't dream of stealing. Stealing is wrong.
Yea, I think I'm starting to agree with you. This job isn't so bad, really. It makes me feel good for some reason. Well, I've got to go before I get in trouble.
Please don't hurt me or my brahmin.
Don't hurt me!
Stop it!
Please leave me alone.
You're scaring me.
Hey what are you trying to do? I don't have anything you'd want.
Stop that!
Dangerous? No, not really. They can give you a really nasty bite, but they're pretty cool. They fart and burp a lot. I don't know why.
So what's the spear for?
Okay, thanks.
Oh, they can be awfully stubborn when I want them to do something. I just gently stick them to get them to move around . . . plus I don't want to get too close; they sometimes kick. 
Please don't talk to me. Dan is going to yell at me again. He really gets pissed - I mean - mad, when I'm not paying attention to what I'm doing.
He's just trying to help. Work hard and I'm sure he'll be nicer.
Here kid, take  bucks and get away from this jerk.
Okay.
Aaaaaarg!
Rhu?
Please don't, I'm already in enough trouble.
I AM working hard!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. He's just trying to help you.
No you aren't, you lazy little skeev!
Okay. 
Yea, maybe you're right . . . actually, he seems pretty cool, but I wish he wouldn't yell at me so much.
Yea, right.
Up yours, you old fart!
Up yours, you old hag!
WOW! I can live on this for the rest of my life! Thanks a lot, mister!
WOW! I can live on this for the rest of my life! Thanks a lot, ma'am!
WOW! Thanks . . . Well? . . . You're just trying to get me in trouble again!
Please don't talk to me, Dan is really mad.
Don't worry. I had a talk with him, he'll try to be nicer to you.
And he should be! You're a terrible kid!
Wac.
Hi!
Those girls over there sure are dumb.
Hi again.
Brahmin are cool.
Dan's taking me to the Falcon if I do a good job.
Dan's going to take me on a caravan some day!
I'm going to be an adventurer when I grow up.
Really? Oh, okay. I hope you didn't hurt him. He's really not so bad. He just yells a lot.
Hello again.
What is it you do again?
Can I have a brahmin?
Just stopping by to see how things are going. Bye.
Arg!
Ta.
I'd better get back to work.
Those girls over there sure are dumb.
Hi again.
I'm going to be an adventurer when I grow up.
Brahmin sure do shi . . . uh, poop a lot.
I can't talk right now.
I don't want to get in trouble.
You see Bob, proprietor of Bob's Iguana Bits.
Ok, Ok, I've got your money.
I've got more expenses. I need to increase the payment.
Screw this. I want ALL of your money now, or you're a dead Bob.
I can't take the heat. I'm calling off the payments.
I want information on Decker.
I want information on Doc Morbid.
Gimme' an iguana on a stick.
I'm sorry. I ain't payin' no more. Do what you want with me.
Bob, I thought we were pals! In fact, I was thinking about giving you a promotion in my organization. Instead, you betray me. This is very disappointing...
Bob, why should I take no for an answer? Especially from a scumbag like you?
Glad to see you're standing up for yourself.
Your reputation is history, Bob. Hi-sto-ree!
Fine, I'll decide what to do with you later.
Well, it was nice knowing you Bob. Say 'hi' to Satan for me.
What are you doing back so soon? It ain't time for the payment.
You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. Get lost!
Hey, I don't want any trouble!
Hi! Welcome to Bob's Iguana Bits, the family eating place. Can I take your order?
Forget it.
You are? Well, Ok...
He's a mean son of a bitch. You don't want to mess with him. Anything else?
Fine. What do you want me to pay?
I want 
 bucks every five days.
Doc Morbid? All I know is that he's up around Junktown and he's the cheapest source of food I could find. That's all!
Let's see what I've got in stock.
I've got a whole iguana for twenty caps.
I've got prime cut choice for eight caps.
I'll take one of the real ones.
Nothing for me right now. I'm on a diet.
I'll take one of the prime cuts.
I could go for some prime cut right now. I'll even pay for it.
Uhh... Me no hungry now.
Fine! Take your money and get out!
You can stick it! I ain't ever payin' you! Get lost!
Yeah, sure. Why don't you find someone else to screw over.
You can't throw crap without getting some of it on your fingers. Get out of here!
Sure you will. Get lost!
Sorry. We're all out of iguana.
We only have whole iguana on a stick. Twenty bucks each.
We only have prime select choice. It tastes great, though. Eight bucks each.
Sure. We got whole iguana on a stick for twenty bucks, and our prime select pieces for eight bucks.
I'll take a whole iguana.
I'll take your prime select.
You know, I hear your prime select tastes like chicken. Do you like eating cowardly guys?
No sissy portions! Me want all iguana! Ugh!
Hmm, smell good! Me want prime!
Never seen any of them around here. Water Merchants don't need 'em.
Water Merchants?
Mr. Decker is a distinguished businessman in a less than distinguished business. Anything else?

What kind of business?
What are you talking about?
Your secret ingredients. How fresh does the corpse have to be before it develops a bitter aftertaste? Do you use mutants, humans, or a mix?
I found an invoice in Doc Morbid's lair. An invoice for dead bodies...
If you've got a memory loss, I can talk to the sheriff.
Prime Choice Select is made of people!!!! It's made of people!!!
Nothing. Sorry to bring it up. Now is there anything else I can do for you?
Well, he's dead now, and my cash flow has increased because of it.
Someone killed Decker. We're in mourning. [snicker]
Someone shot Sheriff Greene. Don't know about the deputy, though.
Daren Hightower was murdered. And all that money couldn't save him. Ironic, ain't it?
Someone stole a necklace from the Hightowers. Man, did they ever make a big mistake. They're dead for sure!
Someone killed Jain over at the Cathedral. I hear she was a real pain in the butt!
Well, the only new thing is that the Children of the Cathedral has taken over the Hospital. It's pretty boring around here lately.
Anything else?
Man, I'm gonna be out of business in a week. Anything else, oh high and mighty?
I don't like your attitude.
Sorry, you can't afford it.
One whole iguana coming up! Anything else?
You know what they're made from and you still want one? You make Decker look like a charity worker! Anything else?
I don't like your attitude.
Sorry, you can't afford it.
One iguana prime select choice, coming up! Anything else?
Smart choice. You could stand to lose a few pounds.
Wh...what! Oh, I see, you're joking...
Of course I am...
No, I'm not. I'm going to see that you pay for your crime.
No, I'm not. And I want a piece of the action.
You must be new in town if you're asking me about the Water Merchants. Water is life, and you don't get much more powerful than life and death.
Who's in charge of the Water Merchants?
If there's anything that involves misery and suffering in the Hub, Decker either controls it or wants to control it. Anything else?
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't appreciate your slander! I suggest you don't show your face in here again.
Don't do that! Fine, I've been using some questionable portions. But it's not like I'm committing murder. Doc Morbid's stuff is already dead, isn't it?
I'm sure it is, Bob. Have a nice day...
Cannibalism is a crime against humanity, Bob. I'm going to see that you pay for it.
Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. I don't care. I want a piece of the action.
Not so loud! I don't need you saying that all over the Hub...
I guess I was rude. Have a nice day...
You know, the police station is just across the street. I really should take a little walk.
I can get even louder. But I can also shut up. Noise is cheap, silence is expensive.
How the hell am I gonna pay you if you eat all my stock? Fine! Have another iguana! I hope you choke on it!
I don't like your attitude.
Tough. You want money, I'll give it to you. You want food, I'll give it to you. You want to die, I'll arrange it. But "like" ain't part of the equation.
Nothing I can think of. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a business to run.
Sorry, we're all out of iguana.
We only have whole iguana on a stick. Twenty bucks.
We only have prime select choice. Eight bucks.
Again? Man you must be hungry. We got whole iguana on a stick for twenty bucks, and our prime select pieces for eight bucks.
I'll take a whole iguana.
I'll take your prime select.
You know, I hear your prime select tastes like chicken. Do you like eating cowardly guys?
No sissy portions! Me want all iguana! Ugh!
Hmm, smell good! Me want prime!
How the hell am I gonna pay you if you eat all my stock? Fine! Have another iguana! I hope you choke on it!
I don't like your attitude.
Uh, bye.
Wait a minute. We've got to find a way to reach a mutual understanding!
The only way you'll be able to keep me quiet is to kill me.
Sorry, no deal.
Fine. What can I get out of this?
Fine. What do you want me to pay?
I want bucks every five days.
I don't think I'll blackmail you. Carry on.
I'd change your mind if I were you, friend. People have died for less in the Hub.
Fine. It's a deal. 
bucks, due every five days. I guess I'll see you in five...
No way I'm going for that. I can't afford more than what I'm paying you now.
Too bad, Bob. I'd hate to start singing.
Fine. We'll stay with the current arrangement... for now.
Can you afford a funeral, Bob?
Fine. Maybe it would be good if our paths didn't cross again.
You may be a songbird, but I'm the golden goose. You ain't gonna sing, not when I'm the only goose you've got. Now get out!
First sensible thing I remember you saying. Now get out!
Gimme' an iguana on a stick.
What can you tell me about a Water Chip?
What can you tell me about Decker?
I think we need to talk about Doc Morbid and some of your secret ingredients.
Do you know anything about the missing caravans?
What, me trouble? What gives you that impression?
Anything interesting happening in the Hub?
Me hungry! Grrrrr!
Terrible business. Those poor people. Oh, those poor people. Losing their lives in such a ghastly way! Is there anything else I can do for you? Like feed you, perhaps?
Nothing, bye.
Me go now.
This is no time to sit down! Get moving!
You see a teenager.
You! You did it! When I grow up I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you! You killed them all! Aaaaaalllll! [Uncontrolled sobbing].
It was the only way. The only way to stop them.
How in Hell did you survive the nuke?
It's a lie, kid. I didn't do it!
You'd better go find a doctor, kid. You've got radiation sickness.
You know kid, I don't need some tough guy trying to take me out twenty years down the road. Say good-night, brat.
I heard about you. You run around the Wastes killing kids! Help! Nightkin!
You're mistaken, child. I'm a good man.
Yeah, and if you don't shut up, you won't live long enough to have nightmares.
I ain't here to bother you kid, so just be quiet.
I do what? They not just small guys?
Okay. I'll be quiet. But I hope the Nightkin get you!
Nightkin! Nightkin!
Maybe it was someone else. But if it was you, I'll find you one day when I get older, and I'll make you pay!
Hello, sir. Do you need a meditation flower?
Hello, ma'am. Do you need a meditation flower?
Child, has anything interesting happened here lately?
Of course, child.
Not right now.
Flower pretty?
Get that weed out of my face, you little brat!
I heard Father Morpheus had a visit from the Master himself. He's real happy right now.
Anything else?
I'll bet.
Not right now.
Flower pretty?
Get that weed out of my face, you little brat!
Father Lasher says I have to keep my big mouth shut. He's no fun!
C'mon kid. Surely, you've seen something!
Father Lasher?
Fun good.
Sounds like he and I have a lot in common.
That's great! May the Master bless you. [He hands you a flower.]
Aw! You're no fun. Maybe I should tell the Nightkin about you!
The Nightkin are my friends.
You're a little too young to understand how much fun I can be.
Go ahead. And I'll tell them about you.
You start telling anyone about me, kid, and you're dead!
Sure is. I picked it myself from a grove across town. Well, it was nice meeting you. May the Master bless you.
What'd I do? What'd I do?!
Are you sure you don't want a flower?
I'll take it if you tell me what's going on around here.
Fine. I'll take it.
Sorry kid. I'm not a flower kinda guy.
Sorry kid. You're a little too young to be giving me flowers.
I dunno. Why you ask?
I can't tell you that! The Nightkin would eat me!
He's my teacher. He says every lash we receive brings us closer to the Master!
What a charming man. We really must talk.
Don't believe him kid.
Where is this bastard? I'll kill him.
Teacher? What need teacher?
And you still haven't learned when to shut up? You must have dung for brains, kid.
Uh, bye!
Yeah. It is. Well good-bye_ ur_ may the Master bless you!
But the Nightkin like me! They told me that if anyone bothered me, they'd kill 'em. So there!
I heard there's a secret passage around here, but I haven't found it yet. Supposed to be real dangerous. Only Morpheus and the Nightkin are allowed there. Well, I'd better go. Praise the Master!
That's too bad. May the Master bless you anyway.
Please don't tell him I said anything to you! Please!
Don't worry. When I'm through with him, he won't remember a thing.
I won't. I promise.
Mind your own business, kid.
Rar! What you say?
Life is tough. Learn to take it, kid, and quit whining.
But I must! I must! Disbelief is pain!
Please don't! He loves me! He's the only one who does.
That's okay, I guess. May the Master bless you. Bye.
Thank you! Oh thank you! May the Master bless you. Bye.
Okay I will . . . (sniff) Maybe Father Lasher will be more kind to me after the Master takes over the world.
And when's the Master going to take over the world?
Tell me more about this, kid.
He won't be. He'll get worse. But if you're smart, make yourself her favorite and he'll let you torture the new kids that come in.
Ugh! Me like kindness.
Soon, or so they tell me. We're going to have peace, and unity and the Holy Flame will be lit. And maybe Father Morpheus won't be quite so loud, either.
Anything else?
Father Morpheus?
Loud sucks!
Uh, I really don't know very much. Honest. Bless the Master! Bye!
Hi. How are you?
Fine, kid. What's the good news?
Okay. So you got any dirt for your old friend?
Pretty good. How about you?
I dunno. Bored.
I feel lousy. Do you know how long it's been since I killed anything?
Uh, hello.
Hello kid. Can you tell me what this place is about?
Hi kid. What're you doing in this joint?
Hi kid. How're you doing?
Out of my face, brat, or I'll turn you into a belt!
Hello? Rhyme with yellow! Funny!
This is the Cathedral of the Children of the Cathedral.
I don't know why they say Cathedral twice. We worship the Master, and we yell a lot about Peace and Unity. It sounds kind of dumb, but the Master's real smart, so I guess it must be okay.
Tell me more about the Master.
Sounds dumb to me, too. What are you doing here?
Don't talk about your elders that way, okay?
What kind of a brainwashed little fool are you? You're going to grow up to be one of these zombies! I should kill you now!
I give out flowers. Every petal is peace, and the stem is unity. Or are the petals unity and the stem peace? Oh no, I don't remember! Do you want one?
I'll take one if you tell me what's going on around here.
Sure.
No, thanks.
Screw peace. Screw unity. And get that flower out of my face!
Father Lasher says I shouldn't talk to strangers . . . until we have Unity, of course; then nobody'll be a stranger. Bye!
I'm okay. At least until Father Lasher's next lesson.
Maybe if you studied harder, the lessons wouldn't be so bad.
Tell me more about Father Lasher.
What kind of lesson?
Stop whining, you little brat, and be grateful that somebody's bothering to teach you!
I never do good enough! Never!
[done]
You see a Chanter of the Children.
The Master will forgive your sins! Join us and be free! Praise to the Master and his mercy!
Hello, friend! The Master's vision has made me truly alive for the first time. May I share my wonderful story with you?
Where might I meet this Master?
Go ahead.
Who's in charge here?
Master's Vision? Is it better than Rad Scorpion Juice?
Does it end in death? If not, I can change that!
Me like story!
The Master looks above! The Master sits below! Watch the Peace and the Unity grow!
There was once a man who was so full of hate that he nearly died. But now . . . Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame! Praise the Vineyard of Life! Whee!
You are in charge, friend, but the Master is your guide. Praise the Master! Praise the Holy Flame that lights our way!
The Master's vision is much better than any drink, or even sex! Ohhhh! He transcends both vice and virtue! Ahhhh! The Master is both father and lover to us all!
No story ends in death, as long as the Master is here to protect us!
But I must praise the Master! Farewell, my friend! I'll tell the story later!
But I must praise the Master! Farewell, my friend! I'll tell the story later!
You see a small child.
Hi!
Hello.
Where are your parents?
Erf.
I dunno. Around here somewhere.
You're funny!
Hey, are you gonna kill someone?
Yes.
No!
Erf.
I'm gonna tell my mommy!
Then you shouldn't carry around a weapon like that.
Huh?
I da know. Ask mommy.
Ask daddy.
Wah! Nightmare monster!
Big meanies!
I da know.
Big stinkies.
Ask mommy.
Funny sea songs.
Big meanies!
Bad man.
I'm not tellin' ya.
Big city.
I'm not tellin'.
Nope, not gonna tell ya.
Mommy doesn't want me to talk about him.
Daddy thinks he's funny.
Big peoples.
They have those stinkies that pull them.
Nice people. They give me candy.
They don't like to play hide and seek.
Scary place.
Yucky place.
Scary place.
Scary place.
Mommy won't let us play there.
Daddy keeps telling us to play there.
Big people area.
Big people area.
Moo.
Moo!
Moo, I say.
It's a wild Brahmin.
There is nothing natural about these cows. The second head can only be the result of some strange mutation.
Looks pretty normal to you.
You see a weather-beaten farmer.
Good day.
Hello.
Hubip.
Hello again.
What can I do for you?
What's your name?
What can you tell me about your village?
What are you doing?
Nothing, thanks.
I am called Curtis.
Our village is small, but we support ourselves. Aside from the attacks by raiders and the occasional Rad Scorpion, we have no problems. Aradesh is a good leader.
I am a farmer. We irrigated the desert many years ago. Although the wasteland is harsh, it is possible to grow things with patience and time.
I see. You seem to be doing pretty well.
*You have all of your fields planted right now? You could
probably do better with crop rotation.
Crop rotation? What's that?
Never mind.
You only plant some of your fields, allowing the others to get back some of the nutrients that the plants used up. You let the other fields become fertile again by just tilling up whatever grows there.
Huh. Never thought of that. Makes sense, though. Good idea.
an I ask you another question?
You gain  experience points for helping to improve the agriculture of Shady Sands.
Decker has no wish to talk to you any more.
You see Decker.
Decker is too busy to speak to you. Do your joband come back later.
So. You're looking for a job. How fortunate. I have one that needs doing. Ahh, but where are my manners? What's your name?
I am 
.
What business is it of yours?
Well, the pleasantries are now concluded. Do you wish to hear about the job?
That's why I'm here.
Not particularly.
Background: There's a certain merchant who's . . . how to phrase this . . . not cooperating fully with the Underground.
And the job?
Quite simple. Hunt down the merchant and his wife and exterminate them. 
You mean kill them?
How much for the job?
I can't do that!
All a matter of semantics, but yes. Kill them. Will you take the job?
Umm, sure -- why not?
No! That would be wrong!
How much?
Oh, excellent. The standard pay is  Scripts to open, and another  . . . to close.
Where can I find this merchant?
They live in the Heights, on Barter Street and Thunder Avenue. Complete the job and return.
Okay, I will.
How will you know I killed them?
I don't think so.
Quite excellent. My assistant will renumerate you on the way out. Please, close the door behind you.
Trust me. I'll know.
Okay, I'll do it.
Pass.
I must confess feeling a bit . . . disappointed in you. But these things happen. You will remember this is confidential. Good day.
It's standard pay.  caps to start, another  when the job is done. Will you do it?
No, thanks.
Yeah, I'll do it.
Very nice. The merchant lives in the Heights, on Barter Street and Thunder Avenue. Your initial pay will be handed to you on your way out.
Everything is my business in the Hub. Either tell me, or you may leave.
My name is 
.
I'm not telling you anything.
I see . . . My assistant will show you to the door.
I'm very proud of you. You're ruthless, an attribute I admire. Kane will give you your payment. I hope you're available in the future.
Can I ask you a few questions?
Thanks.
Under the circumstances, yes.
What's in the Hub?
Heard any rumors?
Nevermind.
bKeep it brief, please.
The Merchant Market is in the center of town, surrounded by a number of establishments. You have the Heights to the west, and Old Town to the east.
What kind of establishments?
Thanks for the information. Can I ask you a few more questions?
You're in the Maltese Falcon. There's also the All in One Store, the Armory, the Friendly Lending Company, the police and, unfortunately, the Children of the Cathedral hospital.
Doesn't sound like you're a fan of the Children. What's up?
Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?
They . . . encroach. Let's leave it at that, shall we?
Okay. Can I ask you a few more questions?
I'm not a tour guide. Go see for yourself.
Can I ask some more questions?
True. Tour guides would be much nicer.
No. Please get your payment and leave.
Pardon me? 
You heard me.
Nothing. Can I ask you some more questions?
You are arrogant. My assistant will show you through . . . I mean . . . to the door.
No.
Well, can I ask you something else?
You're a cranky guy.
Someone appears to be stealing whole caravans from the Far Go Traders. And the Thieves' Circle is causing their normal minor difficulties.
# Line  has been changed due to gender issues. See lines -.

Sure.
No way in Hell!
Excellent. You see, the last job I gave you was a test and you did exceedingly well. Now comes a job of importance.
Which is?
Sounds scary. I don't think I'm interested.
As you may know, the Children of the Cathedral have been gaining influence in this town, and frankly, I won't stand for it.
So what do you want me to do?
A small matter. Kill the High Priestess, Jain. Once she's gone, this little nuisance will be ended. Interested?
Absolutely.
But that would be immoral!
I believe I'm beginning to like you. The pay is  up front and  upon completion. And trust me, I'll know when it's done.
Okay.
Talk to Kane on your way out. He'll provide you with details.
And killing the merchant wasn't?
Well, all right, I'll do it.
I don't care. I won't do it.
The pay is  in advance and  upon . . . execution. And trust me, I'll know when it's over.
Okay.
# Line  has been changed due to gender issues. See -.

What a pity. Are you certain you won't even hear what the job is?
Yep, I'm not gonna do it.
Okay, what is it?
Then we have nothing more to discuss.
Exceptional job. I believe the religious faction shall not interfere anymore. Speak with Kane for your reward. My thanks -- and I will certainly keep you in mind in the future.
Put that down.
I am quite a patient man, but even I have limits. Kane, teach this simpleton a lesson.
Stop that.
Talk to Kane about that. He can tell you more.
As I said . . .
Like I said . . .
I already told you . . .
Weren't you listening to me? I said . . .
Be advised: I am unaccustomed to repeating myself.
I will not say that again.
You have no need to know anything else about me.
Most people do not bandy the name of my organization around lightly. We control the Hub.
My mother, finest woman I've ever known, gave me the idea for this, the finest entertainment establishment in all the Hub.
They steal from the merchants and give to the poor, or some such nonsense. They are inconsequential to me. That old mutant, Harold would know more.
He's the head of the police. Nice guy, if you like the straight arrow, honest type. Not like his father; now there was a loyal man.
Harold's been around for some time. He's over in Old Town. A good source for certain types of information.
They control the water. Go to the south end of the Merchant Market, you'll find them there.
He's the head of the Water Merchants.
They used to control the hospital until the Children took over. Now they sit and brood in their warehouse - very strange. You will find them at the northwest end of the Merchant Market.
He's the head of the Crimson Caravan.
They're the last of the merchants, and I mean that literally. Small time stuff, mostly. Look northeast of the Merchant Market.
Amusing. He considers himself the leader of the Far Go Traders. More of a figurehead, actually. He knows better than to interfere with my business.
She's in charge of the Weapons Store.
Something is making the Far Go Traders' caravans disappear. I'd like to know the cause, since it does disrupt a piece of my business.
It's in the center of town.
Myths and legends. The Death Claw is supposedly a ghost or something.
Old Town takes up the entire east side. The skags live there.
Most merchants live there. Simply go west from here.
An annoying organization. Soon they may need a demonstration in the management of power.
Morpheus is the head of the Children of the Cathedral. He resides down in the Boneyard.
She's presently the head of the Children of the Cathedral in the Hub. I've reason to believe that may change soon.
One of the fabrications of the Children. He's supposedly some minor deity, or something.
It's a small place that sells . . . fair weapons. Over by the Far Go Traders.
Just out the door and to the north. You can't miss it.
That's not important.
What? That isn't important now.
Really. Now why would I want to do that?
I see you have disposed of my Second. I will have to take care of you myself.
How good to see you Sheriff Greene! I see you've come to say your goodbyes.
Good day again, my friend. I have another job for you. Are you interested?
Good day again, my friend. I have another job for you. Are you interested?
And I had such hopes for you! But I can't have you warning the Children. Kane, remove our friend here and pass along some instructions on silence.
And I had such hopes for you! But I can't have you warning the Children. Kane, remove our friend here and pass along some instructions on silence.
That's not important.
What? That isn't important now.
You see a dying mutant.
The mutant is near death.
You see the body of a mutant.
The mutant is dead.
It was so fast... My brothers were gone... Could not help...
Who are you?
I, I'm... I can't remember... Was the leader of... It... Maybe my holodisk... [The mutant weakly hands you a bloody Holodisk]
Where did you come from?
We... We were scouting for primes... Came from... From the northwest.
Who sent you?
Father... Where are you father?... Yes Master... [The mutant breathes his last breath and collapses]
Uhhhh.... Arrgghh....
Master....
Brothers... Where...?
I don't want to talk to you.
Go away.
Leave me alone!
Someone should do something about you.
Get out of here, you asshole.
I want nothing to do with you.
Although the fruit here appears abnormal, you recognize it and recall that it has healing properties.
What do you want?
Leave me alone.
What?
Don't mess with my stuff.
Hi.
Arrrr!
Grrrrr!
Uungh.
Uhh.
Hey, did you hear that Set was offed?
Set's dead. Set's dead. Set's dead . . .
There's enough water to go around for everyone. Set makes sure of that.
I heard that the mutants got run out of town.
Ever since the mutants left, it's been better.
Hello.
You examine the pitiful thing, but can not figure out what might have made it the way it is.
It seems to have been human once, or at least descended from humans. You guess that the deteriation in the body is most likely due to acid or radiation.
The body of the humanoid looks to be highly irradiated, but still functioning. While it was once human, it seems to have reverted to a more animalistic lifestyle.
The body of the humanoid looks to be higly irradiated, and much of the muscle and brain matter seem to have deteriorated. However, genetic indicators lead you to believe that it desceded, like you, from those that entered the Vaults.
You have been radiated!
Stop!
Die, human!
To the death.
You will pay for your sins!
You are not supposed to be armed in this area, little brother. Explain yourself.
You are not supposed to be armed in this area, little sister. Explain yourself.
Hngg.
It's okay, I work here.
It's okay, I have a pass.
I am armed by permission of the Lieutenant.
What manner of treason is this?!
Show me your pass, then.
I, uh, left it in my other robe.
It's right here, stapled to the front of my gun.
Hurry on your task then, but be warned, I'm watching you.
Yes, little brother. What is it that you need from me?
Yes, little sister. What is it that you need from me?
Hng!
Hmm, where's this Master guy?
Praise to the Unity, brother.
I am sorry, but you will have to find the way to Unity yourself.
You are obviously a heathen! Pay for your sins!
He resides on Level , as he must. Why do you ask such a silly question?
Oh, uh, no reason.
I am going to kick his ass from here to, uh, someplace really far away!
What question? I said 'Hail to the Master, goodbye.'
You insult me! Die!
Praise to the Unity.
You sound like you do not believe what you say. Could this be true? Or have you left the path of righteousness?
You mistake the tremor in my voice for fear when it is actually a cold of some sort.
I think your kind is doomed, actually. Here, let me prove it with some help from my friends . . .
When you become one of us, you will not fear such minor things. Begone.
What do you want this time? I have little time for your talk.
Labbo!
I have little time for your life . . . Die!
Nothing, sorry.
Praise to the Unity, brother.
Just who are you? Let me see . . . Argh! An intruder . . .
Move along. Do your part for the Unity and stop bothering me!
Get going.
Move along. Do your part for the Unity.
Stay out of our way!
Kill or be killed!
Enjoy your victory, and pray to your gods that we never meet again!
I have no time for talk!
 Beth is female. She speaks with a normal accent. She is a friendly person
 who is mostly interested in selling equipment and information.
You see Beth, owner of the Weapon Shop.
Hi there. How can I help you?
Can I ask you some questions?
Could I ask you some more questions?
I want to buy something.
I have something to sell.
How does someone make money around here?
Nothing. Bye.
Ruk?
What's the word out on the street about the missing caravans? 
 the Deathclaw is male
What do you know about the Deathclaw?
Could you tell me about the Deathclaw again?
 Decker is male
What can you tell me about Decker? 
What can you tell me about the different merchants?
Have you heard any good rumors?
Thanks, that's all. Bye.
Umm, never mind.
 Jain is a female religious figure
Well, I'm not one to gossip, but I heard that Decker's death is somehow related to the assassination hit on Jain.
 The Maltese Falcon is a bar
Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but I know someone who knows someone that says that they saw three
extremely large robed figures go into the Maltese Falcon right before the murders.
 the Children of the Cathedral is an organization - religious
Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but someone killed Jain, the High Priestess of the Children of the Cathedral. I don't care for them myself, but I don't know what she could have done to deserve that.
 The Brotherhood of Steel is an organization - religious
Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but a merchant friend of mine saw a group of mutants wandering around in the desert up past the Brotherhood of Steel, far to the Northwest.
Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but the Children of the Cathedral have been asking people where you are. I'd be careful. They're a strange bunch.
Well, I'm not one to gossip, but I heard that Decker's death is somehow related to the assassination hit on Jain.
There is something else. I know someone who knows someone that says that they saw three extremely large robed figures go into the Maltese Falcon right before the murders.
There is something else. Someone killed Jain, the High Priestess of the Children of the Cathedral. I don't care for them myself, but I don't know what she could have done to deserve that.

Anything else?
Thanks, can I as you another question?
Okay, thanks.
I'm sorry, what was that?
 Klug and Ruk are a stupid person saying something incomprehensible
Klug?
Ruk!
I'm sorry, I don't understand. Please come back when you are feeling better.
 The Merchant Market is a location
Well I'm not hiring but there's a job post in the center of the Merchant Market, you might want to check there.
Okay, thanks.
No, nothing good at least. Give me a chance to do some digging. <She winks at you>. Anything else?
Yes.
No.
What else can I do for you?
Of course you can, don't be silly.
Why sure, I'd be happy to help. What did you need to know?
All right. Well it's been nice talking to you, have a nice day.
No, that's all. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?
Yes.
No.
Well come back soon. Don't be a stranger.
Now there's someone you don't ever want to mess with, he scares me. He 'owns' the Maltese Falcon.
Why did you say it like that? He 'owns' the Maltese Falcon.
Why does he scare you? 
Sorry, it just reminds me of a friend that used to own it before him. Decker wanted it really bad, but my friend wouldn't sell. Two days later they found him dead in a back alley of Old Town.
Why do you think Decker's responsible?
Well he should have known better than to mess with Decker.
Sorry, but I have to go.
My friend was a clean freak. He wouldn't come within a hundred yards of Old Town. He was shot with a Magnum; no one in Old Town could afford one of those. Plus, he was shot once in the head and twice in the back. Does that sound like a robbery? My friend was just trying to get his life back.
Hey, I like his style. After you kill him, put his body in the place he despises the most.
Get his life back?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, okay.
You probably don't understand, but most of us look forward to the day when we own our own lives. When our lives don't belong to the merchants or the money lenders.
Oh, thanks.
Don't you ever stop talking?!
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard!
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Well, excuse me. YOU asked.
He's the deadliest person in the Hub; most say that he runs this place, not the merchants or the police. If you ever cross him, watch out.
That gives him no right to kill anyone.
You make me sick, please leave. I'm sure he's missing your company.
Well, there are three main merchant groups. There's the Water Merchants, the Crimson Caravan, and the Far Go Traders. They also run the city council. What do you want to know about?
The Water Merchants.
The Crimson Caravan.
The Far Go Traders.
The City Council.
That's all. Thanks for the information.
Actually, never mind.
They're in charge of all the water. Greedy people, I wouldn't want to work for them. Their pay is the worst and the jobs are just as bad.
Did they always control all the water? 
Are they the ones behind the missing caravans?
Thanks, another question about the merchants . . .
Thanks, bye.
What else would you like to know about?
No. From what I've heard, a while back a group of merchants seized control of the water tower and proclaimed that they were the water merchants and people had to get water from them. The merchant war raged on for years until a man named Roy Greene - yeah, Justin's Grandfather, that's it - helped to negotiate an agreement that ended the war.
What kind of agreement?
Damn! Sorry I asked.
Thanks, another question about the merchants . . .
Thanks, bye.
Well he set up the city council and set a limit on the price of water. Personally I think they should have beat the tar out of them - oh, sorry. I mean they should have showed them who's boss.
Great. I didn't need quite that much information but thanks just the same.
Thanks, another question about the merchants . . .
Thanks, bye.
Sorry I tend to get carried away with myself. Was there anything else you wanted to know about?
The Crimson Caravan are a bunch of crazy people. They will do any job, no matter what the risk. I'm surprised they aren't missing more caravans than they are.
They're missing caravans too?
How risky?
Thanks, another question about the merchants . . .
Thanks, bye.
They will pass right through an area known to be attacked by raiders. They charge a lot so they can hire extra hands. The pay's great but you have to be alive to spend it, right?
They're missing caravans too?
Thanks, another question about the merchants.
Thanks, bye.
Actually all the merchants have had a few caravans disappear. The Far Go Traders are just unlucky, I suppose.
How risky?
Thanks, another question about the merchants . . .
Thanks, bye.
The Far Go Traders pay well and their jobs aren't too deadly. Butch owns this shop, a good man. They're fair and let me do as I please with the place; I like working with them. Plus you get a discount on anything you buy here if you work for Butch.
Personally I don't think so. I think it was the Deathclaw or maybe the Brotherhood of Steel.
Why don't you think it's the Water Merchants?
What exactly is a Deathclaw?
Could you tell me about the Deathclaw again? 
Who are the Brotherhood?
Why do you think it was the Brotherhood of Steel?
Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
Okay, well I got to go.
Some people think the Water Merchants are responsible, but I don't think so. I think it was that darn Deathclaw, or maybe the people over at the Brotherhood of Steel.
Well, I thought that it was destroying the caravans, but I guess not. It's still out there though. There are too many rumors floating around for it not to exist.
I think that's what's taking the caravans. It could also be the Brotherhood of Steel; they're a strange bunch. Some people think it's the Water Merchants, but they're wrong.
Sure.
Because, like I've been telling everyone, they've had a few caravans disappear too. Nothing like what's happening to the Far Go Traders, but they are being affected.
They could be lying or it could be part of their plan to make you believe them.
Why would it happen to the Far Go Traders more than the others? 
Another question about the missing caravans . . .
Thanks, let's get back to the merchants. 
You're full of crap!
Thanks, but I have to go.
Excuse you! You're awfully quick to judge, are you afraid of the truth?
There are six representatives two from each of the main merchant groups. Everything needs at least four votes to be passed. They can never agree on anything.
Good thought, but I highly doubt it. They've been sabotaging each other for years, but this is not their style. They wouldn't spend that much money to take out the caravans. Plus all the caravans are very heavily guarded. You would think someone would escape. They don't have the man power or the cash to pull that off. There would have been at least one survivor.
Yeah, but why would it happen to the Far Go Traders more than the others?
Another question about the missing caravans . . .
Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
Thanks, but I have to go. 
Bad luck? I don't know, maybe they're traveling along different routes than the others. Maybe because they aren't as heavily guarded as the Crimson Caravan but . . . they might have better cargo than the Water Merchants. Who knows. There doesn't seem to be any clear difference between
the three.
The Water Merchants could be lying or it could be part of their plan, to make you believe them. 
Another question about the missing caravans . . .
Thanks, let's get back to the merchants. 
You NEVER stop talking do you!
Thanks, but I have to go.
Excuse me! You're free to leave at any time. If you didn't want the answer you shouldn't have asked.
The Deathclaw is the most evil thing to rise out of the ashes after the War. Some say it's a powerful ghost from the war that haunts the land. It's no ghost, it's as real as you and me. It's  feet tall with teeth as big as your arm. It's some kind of demon that found it's way here when the world was engulfed in fire.
Uh, sorry I asked.
You're crazy! I should just end your misery right here and now.
Do you know anything else about the Deathclaw?
Wow! Do you know where it is?
Well, I know this old mutant in Old Town named Harold. He's seen it. He's the 'only' one that's seen it and lived.
The only one that's seen it and lived?
Yeah, sure, and I'm the Deathclaw's daddy
Yeah, sure, and I'm the Deathclaw's mommy.
Another question about the missing caravans . . .
Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
I'll check it out. See ya.
Uncle Slappy over in Old Town talks about it sometimes, but he's just a crazy old fool.
Another question about the missing caravans . . .
Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
Thanks. I'll check it out. Bye.
You'll see!
Yeah, pretty amazing isn't it. It's down to the southwest somewhere. There's an old mutant in Old Town named Harold who actually saw this thing in its lair. Nicest Skag I know.
Another question about the missing caravans . . .
Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
Thanks. I'll check it out. Bye.
The Brotherhood of Steel is full of crazy people that worship technology; they're to the northwest of here. They make human sacrifices and do all sorts of other terrible things.
That's absurd! Who told you that?
Another question about the missing caravans . . .
Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
That's terrible, thanks for the warning. Bye.
Well, um. I don't remember, but who ever it was wouldn't lie . . . I mean, it might be true! You should be careful just the same.
Another question about the missing caravans . . .
Well, let's get back to the merchants.
You're an idiot!
Look at the time, I've got to go! See ya.
Why, you don't know? [whispering] I heard that they make human sacrifices and do all sorts of other terrible things!
Yes, we do. What's wrong with that?
As a 'MEMBER' of the Brotherhood, I can ASSURE you that NOTHING like that is going on!
Really? I've been there, they seemed strange but not that bad.
Really? I had no idea.
Like you don't know. You're obviously one of them, walking around in that metal suit. You're all a bunch of sick people.
I don't know what you're getting at, but I can assure you nothing 'sick' is going on at the Brotherhood.
Yeah, so. Aren't we all?
I had no idea.
Excuse me, sir. Please put your weapon down.
Excuse me, ma'am. Please put your weapon down.
I'm sorry but I won't help you unless you put your weapon away. This is a shop not an arena.
Uhh . . . well, yeah . . . umm You . . . I . . . Is there anything else you needed?
You never know what a person's really like behind closed doors. You've got to be careful with who you associate yourself with. Was there anything else you needed?
 Not believing the player for a moment, then getting nervous
You're a . . . ? I mean. I didn't mean . . . Umm . . . Lovely day we're having. Don't you think so? So, was there anything else I can do for you?
Another question about the missing caravans . . .
Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.
No, that's it. Bye.
Sure, whatever you say. Was there anything else that I can do for you?
Great! Let me show you what I've got.
I've got the best goods, what are you looking for?
That's what I like to hear! What do you need?
Let's get down to business.
If you've got money, you've got my attention.
My favorite kind of customer!
You want to buy something? Maybe I was wrong about you.
Oh, that's right. You're working for Butch, you get the % discount.
I'll still give you the % discount, because I like you.
Sorry, you don't get a discount anymore.
Show me what you've got.
Do you have anything good?
Well, let's see.
Sure.
What do you have for me today?
That's great. I can always use more merchandise.
I'd be happy to take a look at what you've got.
Don't try to rip me off.
I might let you sell me something, it better be good.
You better not be wasting my time.
I hope you have something I need, this time.
Hello again. Nice to see you. How can I help you on this fine day?
Why hello! It's nice to see you again. What can I do for you today?
I wish I could get a day off, it's been so lovely out.
Why hello again, aren't we looking handsome today?
Back so soon? 
You just left. Miss me already?
Need something already.
Long time no see, what can I get you today?
It's been a while, I hope you've been well.
Still alive I see. I was starting to worry. What can I get you today?
There you are. It's been more than a week since you last stopped in. You must stay in touch, you ARE my favorite customer!
Yes?
What?
Are you hear to buy something or what?
This is my shop, you better behave.
What is it!
You again?
Time is money, what is it?
Did you need something?
Did you hear? He's dead! I'm overjoyed! That's the best thing that's ever happened to this city.
I already told you. He's dead! Let's just forget about him, his name brings back bad memories.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he deserved it and I don't feel bad about doing it.
 Sid works for Beth. Sid is male.
You did it? Really? I love you! [Beth looks over at Sid] Don't even think about it wise guy . . . Here, to show my gratitude . . . [Beth gives you six stimpaks. It's not much, but I really appreciate it!
You did it? Really? You're the best! You have no idea how happy I was to hear that he was dead. Here take these . . . [Beth gives you six stimpaks.] It's not much, but I really appreciate it!
Sorry I don't have anything you like.
Don't see anything you like? I'll try to get better goods.
Sorry if you didn't like my offer, but I've got to be able to sell if for a profit.
Don't want to sell after all? That's okay.
Sorry I couldn't help you. Have a nice day.
Maybe next time. Bye.
Hope I can help you better next time.
Stop wasting my time.
If you're not going to buy anything, please leave.
If you didn't want to buy something I wish you would leave me alone.
If you're not selling, please leave.
Don't bother me if you don't want to sell.
Please leave.
I knew you where going to waste my time again.
Figures, I knew you didn't have any money.
Thanks for all the business, maybe I'll go home early today.
You almost cleaned me out!
Hope you can carry all that!
Thanks, I hope I can sell all this stuff!
These should sell well, thank you.
I can use these. Thanks.
I hope I have room for all this!
Well thanks a lot! I hope you have a wonderful day!
Thanks for the business, please drop by anytime.
You're welcome here anytime, during business hours that is.
Thanks you and have a nice day.
Bye! And thanks!
That's it, just ammunition? I'm disappointed. Well, next time you'll need to spend more!
Stocking up on ammunition? It's a good idea. You can never have enough.
Just the essentials, right? Bye!
Well, I didn't think you where actually going to buy anything.
Thanks for the business, you're not so bad.
Thanks for the goods.
Have a nice day.
Bye.
Thank you.
Thanks for the purchases, have a nice day.
I heard that!
No kidding.
Sid! Stop that!
I'll give you a gift if you don't shut up.
I heard that! You're fired!
Ignore him, I always do.
Oh, you're just hilarious Sid.
You wish.
Shut up.
Hey. Stay put Sid.
I don't think so slick.
I'll make you blue if you don't leave my customer's alone.
Please excuse my 'obnoxious' guard.
You're such a knob!
Sid!
Honey? Where do you come up with these disturbing names?
[Beth sighs] I
 should lock him up. Don't you think?
I think he's jealous!
Sid! Don't be rude to the customers!
Anyone else you know who might have some information about the Death Claw?
Goodbye.
Thanks.
Ook.
Is there anyplace in town I should avoid?
Oh yes. You ought to stay as far away from the Maltese Falcon as you possibly can. Decker and his greasy lapdog Kane are bad news. They'll eat you alive if you're not careful. I'd also give Lorenzo at the Friendly Lending company a wide berth.
You have encountered a monastery and a small community built around it.
You like it any better if I tell you to fuck off?
Is there some reason I should be talking to you? {disdaining}
Not much to tell. A brahmin or two loaded up with weapons, and a whole mess of well-armed guards to make sure it ends up where it's supposed to.
The Gun Runners have been putting rapid-fire death-dealing in the hands of anyone who needed to defend himself for over a century.
I'm a salesman. I swing through McCarran and the dam once a week or so to take orders. But lately I spend most of my time in this piss heap.
Am I selling? Yeah. Am I selling to you? No. Sorry to hurt your feelings, but you're small time. Move along.
There's usually a gun merchant hanging around topside. I'm sure she'll take care of you.
Like you have a clue what that even means. {scoffing}
We used to. But every caravan carrying them was getting ambushed and wiped out. By someone sophisticated enough to know which was which.
Still plenty of other problems keeping the 15 shut down, though. Thanks for playing.
[SUCCEEDED] You might be on to something. I like to hang on to any weapons mods I run across...
You like it any better if I tell you to fuck off?
Is there some reason I should be talking to you? {disdaining}
Tell me about Gun Runner caravans.
One nifty bit, though. The gun cases are rigged to explode. So trying to loot one of our caravans doesns how the NCR stays equipped. The only thing we donre the NCRt be forever. Plus I can afford a monthly bender on the Strip and still build up my nest egg.
Ire a Gun Runner?
Why dont bother Primm anymore.
Still plenty of troubles out that way, though. Thanks for playing.
Still, itll be working from here for the foreseeable future.
I figure a guy like you gets his pick of killing gear. (>40)
Take a look.
Do you think the Gun Runners keep the NCR military supplied by carrying weapons and ammo from the Boneyard out here by the armload?
Get a clue. We have caravans. We deal in bulk.
I don't like your attitude.
GREETING
After I win big, I'm going to buy my friends dinner at that fancy Gor-mant restaurant. I saw ads for it back home.
I walked all the way from Hub! Thought I'd rest my feet here a day or two, then I head onto the Strip fresh.
I'll get in, win big, get out. Take those winnings back home where they'll do some good!
You know it's illegal for us to gamble back home? The government wants to keep us poor.
I'm sick of the sob stories you hear around here. If you don't know when to stop gambling, that's no one's fault but your own.
I can't wait to see the Strip. I hear it's so beautiful!
Oh, you could. You just don't want to.
I understand. Sorry to be a bother.
But... Of course. It's all right. Thank you.
Thank you so much! I'm so hungry!
Sorry I had to bother you. I've... well, I've lost everything.
You're very kind. I wish... well, I'll just thank you and leave you be.
I lost everything I had at The Tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, I'd head straight back. Sick, huh?
I came east to strike it rich, and now I'm broker than ever. What do I tell my family back home?
On the Strip, everyone's nice to you when you got the caps. The moment you don't? They throw your ass out.
I won big my first night on the Strip. I kept chasing that feeling. Right into the gutter.
I sat down at a roulette table with my life savings. An hour later, it was gone.
Can you spare some caps, mister?
Can you spare some caps, 'mam?
Go East! they say. Scrap lying in the sun for you to grab. Yeah, right.
The Strip ain't nothing but a monster. Chews folks up, sucks out their caps, and spits 'em back out.
Oh, I don't sell things, mister. I sell {emph} thoughts. {emphasis on "things" and "thoughts"}
Oh, I don't sell things, ma'am. I sell {emph} thoughts. {emphasis on "things" and "thoughts"}
That's not junk. That's other people's thoughts. People had to think to make them, and the thoughts got stuck inside.
I need other people's thoughts to fill my head when I'm not thinking myself. Otherwise it's... kind of empty.
Thinking hurts you, too? Aw, I wish I could let you have the one on my head but I can't. It hurts real bad when I don't wear it.
This thing on my head is headache medicine. It works real good, except I can't think when it's on. {emphasize} Really think, I mean.
I don't have a mama or papa anymore. I see them sometimes when I take off my medicine, but they can't stay. I'm pretty used to being on my own.
Great! What do you want me to think about? I can think about You, Here... or Everywhere. What do you want?
Sure, I could do some more thinking. What should I do my thinking about this time?
That's all right, mister. You will someday.
That's all right, ma'am. You will someday.
Sorry, sir. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
Sorry, ma'am. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
I can take off my medicine and do some thinking. People say it's real interesting. I don't know, {'cause} because I never hear it.
Some people say that it's a gift. Other people say that it's the kind of thinking anyone could do if they watched more than they talked.
I don't know which is true. I see a lot, I think a lot. There's a lot to hear through the 188, too, that maybe accounts for the thinking.
Let me take off my medicine...
Bull and Bear over the Dam, at each other's throats... but a light from Vegas? Ball spinning on the wheel, more than two at the table, placing bets. {Spoken in an eerie whisper, prophetic, like Clay's telling a fortune. He's really not, he's just compiling a bunch of images.}
All lose in different ways, a dam of corpses, towns of corpses, scattered across the sand. But whose, in what shares? Even the dealer doesn't know. {Spoken in an eerie whisper, prophetic, like Clay's telling a fortune. He's really not, he's just compiling a bunch of images.}
Forecast: A rain of blood will flood the desert and not purify it.
Bleh. Thinking about Everywhere always makes me feel a little sick...
I thought you'd say that.
Oh, I don't know anything, mister. I just think it, and then I don't.
Oh, I don't know anything, ma'am. I just think it, and then I don't.
Okay. Let me take off my medicine...
{A little slower, more thoughtful} Your face does the thinking - two to the skull, yet one gets up. Odds are against you... but they're just numbers after the two-to-one.
You're playing the hand you've been dealt, but you don't let it rest, you shuffle and stack, and a gamble... a gamble that may pay off? {Frowns} But how?
Forecast: Rapidly changing conditions.
{Frowns, resumes normal voice} A lot of thinking - most of it in your face, it's almost shouting at me. {Beat, slight apology} Sorry if I said anything weird.
I need to take off my medicine...
Local, local, the here and now... little of interest... things to buy, false hopes, and regrets watered down, washed down in dirty glasses. {Spoken in an eerie whisper, a little sing-song this time, prophetic, like Clay's telling a fortune. He's really not, he's just compiling a bunch of i}
With regret comes a girl... smiling sad, brown robe, name Veronica, half here. Wraps her and her heart up like a pack, in the pack, a key, some say. {Spoken in an eerie whisper, prophetic, like Clay's telling a fortune. He's really not, he's just compiling a bunch of images.}
{Slight upbeat at the end, different than the eeriness} Forecast: Cloudy, with a chance of friendship. {Spoken in an eerie whisper, prophetic, like Clay's telling a fortune. He's really not, he's just compiling a bunch of images.}
{Frowns, winces} Ouch. Thinking small only hurts a little, but it's a sharp pain.
Hi, mister. I hope you're doing fine today.
Hello, ma'am. I hope you're doing fine today.
I thought I'd be seeing you again.
This job's boring enough without talking to you. Go see Alexander.
Alexander doesn't pay me to talk.
I can't wait to add the Declaration to the Society's collection.
I'm expecting great things from you!
What wonderful artifacts have you brought me?
So, have you decided to become a part of history and triumphantly return with the Declaration of Independence in hand?
Pleased to meet you. Abraham Washington's the name. I am curator of the Capital Preservation Society.
If you have time, come take a look at our exhibits.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Sorry, very busy right now. Come see me at the museum.
Quite an impressive collection, isn't it? Well don't be shy, have a look around.
Abraham Washington's the name... curator of this little slice of American History.
What can I help you with?
What brings you by Rivet City today?
I...uh, I don't get visitors very often. My name is Abraham Washington. This is my Capital Preservation Society.
Welcome to...uh...the Capital Preservation Society.
What...uh, what can I do for you?
It's funny, now that you ask... I can tell you all about the Capital, but I really haven't got any idea about Rivet City itself.
I can't see how important it is compared to the Capital's history, but maybe Bannon might know something. He's in the governing council, after all.
It's funny, now that you ask... I can tell you all about the Capital, but I really haven't got any idea about Rivet City itself.
Frankly, it sounds just you're thinking too small, when you could ask about the much more important history of the capital!
Quite a nice specimen you have there. How about I give you 10 caps for it?
That would look fantastic on the museum wall! What do you say to 60 caps?
Lincoln's actual hat? Amazing! I must have it for the museum!
How does 70 caps sound?
Oh my goodness! Hand written by one of the greatest presidents of our country?
The Society must possess this. I'll give you 100 caps for it!
Very well, but I doubt anyone else will appreciate its value as much as I do.
Pennies, eh? That's the old money they used long ago.
Well, any artifact from American history would benefit the museum. How about 15 caps for the lot of them?
An actual recording of Lincoln's voice? Amazing!
Please, allow me to compensate you for it. I'll pay you 60 caps.
I can't believe you have that artifact in your possession! What an amazing addition it would make to the museum.
I will buy it from you for 100 caps. What do you say?
Interesting. I'd love to have that in the museum's collection.
I will buy it from you for 70 caps. What do you say?
Thanks much!
Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
Why, of course I do!
If these items were lost to time, how would we ever be able to explore our heritage or appreciate the sacrifices our founding fathers made?
Then we understand each other. Hundreds of years ago, people studied history as a career. Then, when the bombs fell, it was almost lost.
Can you imagine a country like the U.S.A. without it? It would be the same empty feeling as not knowing your birth mother.
We are children of this country and to respect it is to know about it.
That's just the attitude I have come to expect from uneducated individuals.
It's people like you who will cause the name America to fade from memory. Children will think of the U.S.A. as just the Wasteland.
I mustn't let that happen! That's why this place exists.
Oh, it's so good to finally meet... I mean, to yet again meet someone who actually cares about history!
Bah! Sometimes I feel like it's hopeless.
Sigh. I was hoping seeing these pieces of the past would snap you out of your pessimism. I see I was wrong.
It makes me so happy to hear that! Feel free to look around all you like.
Oh? And have you come to any conclusions?
What? You have the Declaration? Unbelievable!
Are you certain this time? Or is this another joke?
By bringing this to me, do you realize you've just written yourself into the history books?
You're a true American hero and will be remembered for this glorious day!
But enough of that. Allow me to present you with some sort of compensation for your deed.
By bringing this to me, do you realize you've just written yourself into the history books?
You're a true American hero and will be remembered for this glorious day!
But enough of that. Allow me to present you with some sort of compensation for your deed.
By bringing this to me, do you realize you've both just written yourselves into the history books?
You're both true American heroes and will be remembered for this glorious day!
But enough of that. Allow me to present you with some sort of compensation for your deed.
I will award Sydney's promised bounty to her personally. No need to worry yourself about that.
By bringing this to me, do you realize you've both just written yourselves into the history books?
You're both true American heroes and will be remembered for this glorious day!
Sydney's name will forever be memorialized for her great sacrifice. She was a patriot and will be missed.
But enough of that. Allow me to present you with some sort of compensation for your deed.
Well that's just plain rude. I would hope you'd be kinder to an old man just trying to serve his nation!
But, since you brought it up...
Ah, a fellow scholar I see!
Each of the documents in this room tells a small but important story about the history of the United States of America.
Unfortunately, the greatest prize of all is missing from the collection.
One man's garbage is another's treasure trove. Don't underestimate these documents. They may not look like much, but their value is immeasurable.
Or would be anyway, if only I possessed one more item.
Watch your tone, sir. To suggest the destruction of such fine specimens is almost, well... blasphemy!
I'll have you know this collection is a complete chronicle of our nation's history. A unique glimpse into the past.
Well, almost complete. One document still continues to elude me.
In 1776, the Second Judgmental Congress got together and adopted a document drafted by none other than Thomas Jefferson himself.
It was the day the United States of America earned its name and secured its place in history.
This magnificent achievement took form in the Declaration of Independence.
Your rude tone leads me to believe you aren't interested in a little proposal I have for you.
Now, will you hear me out? If not, we don't have much more to talk about.
My friend, the sleeping fox catches no moss.
Would you want to miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime?
Why, yes! Your knowledge of American History is quite impressive!
What an amazing crown jewel in my collection that would be! The original document created by the people, for the people.
Shame. Very well, you're free to look around but with your level of patience I suspect you'll become bored rather quickly.
Indeed I do. Without the Declaration, the rest of these relics are almost meaningless. I must have it!
Acquire the document for me, and you'll be awarded most handsomely. What do you think?
Well, I was hoping you'd realize what I want. I want you to get the Declaration for me.
The Declaration would tie this collection of documents together so well and give it the patriotic meaning it deserves.
If you can find it for me, I'd be sure to make it worth your while.
Oh, would you? It would mean so much to me and the Society's collection here.
A man of few words. Very well.
Get the Declaration of Independence to me intact and I'll pay you well for your time. What do you say?
A woman of few words. Very well.
Get the Declaration of Independence to me intact and I'll pay you well for your time. What do you say?
Please, accept this holotape as a token of my esteem and the esteem of every citizen of the United States.
May it bring you the vocal skills possessed by only the greatest orators of our time.
Well! The founding fathers would be disappointed in your fiery tone.
However, a deal is a deal. Here is your reward.
Marvelous! Then you've decided?
Heroes of the United States will receive rewards befitting their rank, I can assure you. Your prize will be no different.
I have in my possession the only known schematic for the creation of something called the Railway Rifle.
Bring me the Declaration, and it's yours.
Sorry, my mind tends to wander. I would see to it you receive a worthwhile trade.
I have in my possession the only known schematic for the creation of something called the Railway Rifle.
Bring me the Declaration, and it's yours.
Certainly.
What could be more important than completing my collection? Without that document, what is the U.S.A. now? Nothing!
Oh well. Please come back when you change your mind. I know you will.
Oh, it treats me well. I'm sure it will be even better now that we have the Declaration of Independence.
Hopefully, we can add more to the collection and increase our foot traffic!
Well, yes. Any document of historical significance would be of benefit to the Society.
However, I am also interested in branching out. Perhaps some interesting artifacts related to our great country's history.
Be sure and bring me anything you find along those lines. I'd be happy to compensate you once again.
Oh my! I never expected anyone to find this! I didn't even know it was still intact!
Well, certainly a reward is in order for your efforts. How about 100 caps?
Indeed I am. Although there were several copies made of the document, I certainly never expected to come across one intact.
What do you say to 75 caps for it?
How very disappointing!
Such a shame, I was hoping to add it to my collection.
Oh, very well. If you reconsider, you know where to find me.
I assure you no one else in the Wasteland will pay you more, but I respect your decision.
You drive a hard bargain, but it's worth every cap.
Thank you very much!
You drive a hard bargain, but it's worth every cap.
Thank you very much!
A famous man once said that patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish.
I've waited this long, I suppose I can wait until someone else comes along to accept my offer.
You'd secure your place in history. The man who rediscovered the Declaration of Independence. Imagine the fanfare!
You'd secure your place in history. The woman who rediscovered the Declaration of Independence. Imagine the fanfare!
Oh dear. Well, I can't make you go. Only to appeal to your sense of patriotism and to do it for your country.
Excellent! You won't regret it, I promise you! Imagine, you are taking part in another chapter of American History. I envy you.
You can find the Declaration of Independence in the ruins of the National Archives.
Well, yes. Any document of historical significance would be of benefit to the Society.
However, I am also interested in branching out. Perhaps some interesting artifacts related to our great country's history.
Be sure and bring me anything you find along those lines. I'd be happy to compensate you once again.
Please ask then. After all, knowledge is power!
A piece of what was called parchment... sort of a thick paper. Has faded hand-written writing all over it.
It's no more than two and a half feet tall and two feet wide. If you find it, you should be able to roll it up carefully.
On July the 4th in 1776, a group calling themselves the Second Judgmental Congress got together at Fort McHarry in Maryland.
After a ceremony which ended with Paul Revere singing the famous battle hymn known as the National Anthem, the document was signed.
From there, it was sent to England by plane presumably and presented to King George himself. Thus began the Evolutionary War.
Well, ummm. This is quite embarrassing actually.
I sent someone like yourself after the Declaration. She did some of the research for me, but now I haven't seen her in a few months.
I wouldn't worry about it. Many have died for causes far less grand than what you're about to undertake.
Oh my lord, I never expect... I mean, I am utterly shocked!
You have earned your place in the annals of American History, yes indeed. You will be remembered for this great day!
I understand the road was difficult, so allow me to present you with an extra bonus to perhaps whet your appetite for future endeavors.
Enjoy your reward, my friend. You've earned it.
Oh my lord, I never expect... I mean, I am utterly shocked!

Enjoy your reward, my friend. You've earned it.
Oh my lord, I never expect... I mean, I am utterly shocked!
You two have earned your places in the annals of American History, yes indeed. You will be remembered for this great day!
I will award Sydney's promised bounty to her personally. No need to worry yourself about that.
Enjoy your reward, my friend. You've earned it.

Enjoy your reward, my friend. You've earned it.
In the D.C. Ruins you'll find the National Archives. Or what's left of it anyway.
The building should contain the document in a protective glass case. Be careful, the place is swarming with Super Mutants.
Here, let me pinpoint its location for you.
It takes moxie to admit you've done something wrong. I admire that.
I'd be glad to sell it back to you. Here you go.
It takes moxie to admit you've done something wrong. I admire that.
I'd be glad to sell it back to you, but you don't seem to have enough caps. Come back when you do.
Incredible! I've heard of those items. They were used to make music many many years ago I believe.
Well, although it has no American historical significance, I can take it off your hands for 200 caps. How does that sound?
Absolutely! I believe the standing offer was 200 caps.
Well, that's wonderful. Here are your caps. Thanks very much!
Well, that's wonderful. Here are your caps. Thanks very much!
Certainly, don't let me stand in your way.
Well, that's wonderful. Here are your caps. Thanks very much!
Well, that's wonderful. Here are your caps. Thanks very much!
I'm collecting artifacts. Historical artifacts. Um...all sorts of things from old DC.
It's important work. Because...well, it just is.
Certain information came to light. I paid a fortune in caps and obtained it.
There really isn't much more to it.
Oh no no no. That just won't do. 200 Caps is all I'm going to pay.

I scour the wasteland for the very best pieces of trash, the height of detritus, and the veritable pick of the litter. It's all valuable to someone. {Using flowery words to sell bullshit}
And I always make sure to make my rounds through Canterbury Commons. Their mayor, Roe, always has a place for a clever junkman like myself.
Nothing but the highest quality leftovers, junk, and crap!
Crazy Wolfgang's got just what you need! Assuming you need the random junk that I've got.
Let me see if I can't hammer this garbage into shape.
Whatever you've got, I've got just the thing to fix it.
Welcome, sir or madam, to Crazy Wolfgang's Traveling Junk Store! The Depot of Detritus, the Shop of Slop, and the Caravan of Crap! {Talking it up like a carnival huckster}
Now, what odds and ends can I, the Craziest of all possible Wolfgangs offer to you?
I hear you're the one who's so deeply invested in my junk. Not as deeply as me, of course, but who is, really? {Gleefully making crude innuendo}
I picked up some Stealth Boys the other day, and they seemed like just the way to thank you for your investment. Kudos!
A friend with deep pockets is a friend indeed! Welcome to my shop!
Hey, hey! Looking to buy?

Do that again and I'll put my foot so far up your ass you'll cough up boot polish!
What is your major malfunction, maggot?
You make me sick, you worthless scumbag.
Eat hot lead, you commie bastard!
Ready to die for your country?
Pain is just weakness leaving the body!
Today's a hell of day to die, commie!
Come on, people, give 'em hell!
How do you like that, you mother-loving commie!
Made in the U.S.A.!
No surrender!
Is that the best you can do?
I'm just getting warmed up! Hoo-ah!
There's nothing I like better than the smell of plasma in the morning!
What's the matter, you pansy ass pinko? Getting tired?
We are lean! We are mean!
I have a personal message for you from Uncle Sam!
Running will only make the pain last longer!
Kill them all! God will understand.
There's nothing I like better than making some other poor bastard die for his country.
Now you're starting to piss me off.
Tell my mama I've done my best.
Pin my medals upon my chest.
Box me up and ship me home.
Bzzzt. {garbled robot death sound}
Bzzzt. {garbled robot death sound}
Bzzzt. {garbled robot death sound}
You had better remove yourself from this area before I am forced to declare you an enemy of the U.S. of A.
This area is under the protection of the U.S. army. Remove yourself or be prepared to defend yourself.
You're not allowed in here. Don't give me an excuse to use my weapon on you.
Do not push your luck any further.
I'll advise you again to leave immediately or I cannot be responsible for the consequences.
You're taking your life into your own hands.
Bzzt.
Bzzt.
Bzzt.
Vvvvzzz.
Vvvvzzz.
Vvvvzzz.
You are the lowest form of commie scumbag I've ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on!
You seem to need an object lesson in democracy!
I have a personal message for you from Uncle Sam!
Please tell me that you did not just do what I think you did!
I thought I had seen every species of moronic petty bullshit, but you've just topped the list. Congratulations.
Do you have no respect for private property, you slimy little commie bastard?
Did you not realize that I have eyes in the back of my head?

You a merc? 'Cause you don't look like a prospector...
I've still got guns and ammo, if you need them.
Hell, yes sir. Well... not officially. Not anymore. {Emphasis on "officially."}
They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
Hell, yes ma'am. Well... not officially. Not anymore. {Emphasis on "officially."}
They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
Sure do. Lots of folk been coming out east, sorting through junk, looking for whatever they can sell.
Times are tough back home. Too many people, not enough work. Unless you like shoveling brahmin shit.
It means my C.O. was an asshole, and I told him to eat shit. He ordered me to flog a couple "deserters."
Those kids didn't desert. They just got liquored up on the Strip and missed roll call.
I don't know what else the brass expects... half these kids don't get more than two weeks of training before they ship 'em out here.
Staff sergeant, Third Platoon, Bravo Company. I was at the Dam when the Legion hit us, three years back. {Proud of her service}
That was a shitstorm, and don't let anybody tell you different. The brass try to play it down, but most of them were back at McCarran.
Going home didn't feel right, not with those savages camped on the other side of the river, sharpening their knives.
And I still get to see my old platoon when they pass through here... make sure the new C.O. is treating them right, and sneak them extra ammo.
Anyway, I was always complaining about the standard issue gear. The new kids don't even get body armor, can you believe that?
Vegas is bleeding us dry. We're tossing caps at a hundred different problems, while Caesar bides his time and lets us wear ourselves out.
This war is gonna bankrupt the NCR, unless we finish off the Legion fast and dirty. {Emphasis on "fast" and "dirty"}
We shouldn't be perched up at the Dam - we ought to be crossing the Colorado and sticking a boot up Caesar's ass.
So I hooked up with a couple other vets... bribed a Gun Runner...
Now we're supplying grunts, mercs, and anybody else on our side. We don't make much... but at least we're saving lives.
I'll be here a while yet, if you need any guns or ammo.
I didn't. My C.O. ordered me to flog a couple "deserters," and I told him to eat shit. So they kicked me out for insubordination.
Those kids didn't desert. They just got liquored up on the Strip and missed roll call.
I don't know what else the brass expects... half these kids don't get more than two weeks of training before they ship 'em out here.
Sure, no problem.

Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
Well, then, take two shots of whiskey and call me in the morning. Heh heh, little doctor humor. Okay, let's have a look.
Heh. Good luck with that. Just try to remember the Cazadores crawling out of your skin aren't real.
But on the off chance they are, come back and see me.
And there we go. Now, try to stay off the stuff, you hear?
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
You got to be kidding me. You're fine - this is just a ploy to get a free sucker, isn't it?
This doesn't look too bad. We'll have you good as new in no time.
Damn, that's got to hurt. Okay, hold still, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
I wasn't going to say anything, but when you walked in here I thought you were a ghoul. We better get to work on this quick.
All right, just hold steady. Want a shot of whiskey to calm your nerves? Mind if I have one? Heh heh, little doctor humor there.
Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
All right, just hold steady. Want a shot of whiskey to calm your nerves? Mind if I have one? Heh heh, little doctor humor there.
Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
All right, just hold steady. Want a shot of whiskey to calm your nerves? Mind if I have one? Heh heh, little doctor humor there.
Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
You want to play tough guy, that's no skin off my nose.
You want to play tough gal, that's no skin off my nose.
I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
No, sorry, we're totally unprepared to deal with radiation sickness.
Ha ha, just kidding, of course I can!
Whatever you say. Hey, is that a little patch of ghoul rot on your cheek there?
This might tickle a little. Or it might cause searing, agonizing pain to shoot through your body. You never know.
Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
Here's what I've got.
Something I can do you for?
I suppose I can help you out. What do you want?
I'm not really comfortable having you in here, so make it quick.
Hey, friend. Need something?
Glad to see you! Need a patch-job?
I think you'd better get out of here.
There are a half-dozen troopers in shouting distance. Best remember that before you try anything.

Cheerio. Water under the bridge.
Not very sporting of you.
That's hardly Marquess of Queensberry rules, now is it?
You'll pay for that, you cheeky bastard!
Do stand still!
And who gets to clean up all this blood? Me, that's who...
Oohh. Yesss... Let's all beat up on the robot... {Sarcastic and annoyed}
By God, if I had hands I would strangle the life out of you! { }
Have at thee! { }
For Queen and country! { }
You have insulted my honor, and for that, you must die! { }
Oh, I say.
It's all going dark...
So that's it then?

I suppose I'm going to have to do something about that. {heavy sigh at the beginning of the sentence}
The class of people I'm forced to associate with these days just keeps falling.
The class of people I'm forced to associate with these days just keeps falling.
Did you really need that?
Why do I get all the hoodlums?

I'm so relieved we can put that unpleasantness behind us.
I'm sorry that you had to act that way.
I'm afraid that kind of behavior can't be tolerated.
Tsk. I really thought we could be friends.
Please, lower your weapon and submit.
I'm a much better tactician than you. It's all in the brain, you see.
Please don't take this the wrong way.
Which do you like better the psionic beam or the laser?
Nothing personal.
You could run? I am trying to kill you, after all.
I hope this unpleasantness will be over soon.
Hold still please. It's harder to hit you if you keep running around like that.
I hope we can still be friends when this is all over.
Please believe me when I say I'm not enjoying this.
I wish there was some other way we could have worked this out.
I'm afraid I'm a very lethal killing machine.
Running away is probably your only hope.
My programming requires that I keep trying to kill you. {apologetically}
Don't feel bad if you don't defeat me. I am one of the most advanced military robots available. {apologetically}
I'm not programmed to fail. Just so you know. {apologetically}
They could have programmed me to love. To forgive. But nnoooo... {talking to herself, frustrated that she has to kill someone}
I don't mean to be insensitive, but you really can't win. {apologetically}
I calculate your chance of success as... well, no need to be morbid. {apologetically}
Oh no.
I'll miss you.
What are you {cut off in mid sentence}

I don't mean to be rude, but you're not allowed here. You'd better leave before I'm forced to take preventive measures.
You're still within the restricted area. I really do advise you to leave immediately.
Perhaps you didn't hear me the first time. This is a restricted area. Please leave immediately.
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed here. I hope you won't turn this into an unpleasant situation.
I'm sorry. You've entered a restricted area. I may have to use deadly force if you don't leave immediately.
Excuse me, sir, but this is a restricted area. Please leave immediately so we can remain friends.
Excuse me, ma'am, but this is a restricted area. Please leave immediately so we can remain friends.

Even I know that was not a nice thing to do.
Now I'm going to have to do the same to you.
You'll understand that now I have no choice but to employ deadly force.
It's a shame that you had to do that.
I wish you hadn't done that.
I'm sorry. I've been programmed to protect private property at all costs.
I wish I could look the other way, but I'm afraid my programming is very strict.

Mormon caravan from New Canaan came through the other day.
The Crimson Caravan's the biggest merchant outfit in the wasteland.
Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
I'm glad Ringo's back. Got a good story to tell, too.
Fucking expensive to get into the Strip these days.
Keep an eye out for wildlife.
When pay day hits, I'm off to the Strip. Can't wait.
McLafferty's been riding asses again. Better lay low.
McLafferty's a hard boss, but she knows what she's doing, that's for sure.
Guess Jamison won't be showing his face around here again. It's about time.
Tough luck for Janet, huh? I know I'd hate to lose all that pay.
I've never heard of anyone breaking their contract and still getting their pay. Janet is damn lucky.

If you're looking to buy or sell, you've come to the right man. The Crimson Caravan Company has the widest selection in the wasteland.
Hey there. You looking to buy or sell?
See ya.
Can do.
Here you go. Let him know he needs to make another payment if he wants more of this stuff.
Need anything else?
Well, pain-killers are easy to come by, but it isn't easy finding iodine, allergy meds, and a few of these other items. Why do you ask?
Really? Huh, never thought of that. The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
Really? Huh, never thought of that. The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
Won't be a problem. We have plenty of spice traders working with us back home, and we could get meat from local Brahmin ranchers.
The bigger issue is payment. To supply the camp with meat with cost some serious caps.
Excellent. We should be able to get the shipments started in about a week.
[SUCCEEDED] Well, the Far Go Traders have been trying to edge us out on the new armor contract for the troops. This could swing things in our favor.
All right, let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
[FAILED] This is business. I really can't cut them a deal on the cost.
[SUCCEEDED] That should work. We'll do a weighted exchanged based on the going value of meat and vegetables. Water is invaluable in this dusty hole.
Let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
[FAILED] We don't need vegetables, and besides, they spoil. The meat you can dry and turn into jerky.
Maybe. What do you want to know?
Trade routes, my friend, trade routes. Just about every major town in the wasteland has a Crimson Caravan branch in it.
Out here, we usually split our caravans into smaller bands - that way, we don't lose everything if they get hit.
It's not very efficient, though, but hopefully we'll be able to start running larger caravans once things get civilized.
A little place in the NCR called Oak Creek. Used to be a farming town until it got taken over by ranchers.
I didn't want to herd Brahmin for a living, so I signed on with the Crimson Caravan and headed east. Not much to tell, really.
Okay, just let me know when you want to talk numbers.

[Christine nods.]
[Christine raises an eyebrow.]
[Christine narrows her eyes, then shrugs.]
[Christine nods.]
[Christine glances at your companion, shakes her head, then raises her index finger.]
[Christine nods.]
[Christine nods.]
[Christine puts her palm flat and lowers it to the ground, shakes her head.]
[Christine crouches down.]
[Christine raises an eyebrow suspiciously.]
[Christine looks at you and waits.]
[Christine narrows her eyes, nods.]
[Christine frowns, taps the back of her wrist, then circles her finger.]
[Christine nods.]
[Christine nods, and her stance changes slightly.]
[Christine raises an eyebrow, then shrugs.]
[Christine nods, closes one eye and slowly pulls an invisible trigger.]
[Christine tilts her head slightly.]
[Christine nods.]
[Christine nods.]
[Christine nods.]
[Christine nods, makes a half circle with her hand.]
[Christine nods, waits.]
[Christine nods, adjusts her gear.]
[Christine nods.]
Be patient, I'm going. {To herself but chiding the player}Maybe {emph} you should know when to let go. {Christine is walking to the Vault Elevator, asks player to be patient. This is a single bark to prevent breaking scripted sequence.}
{Cold, her voice is slightly torn, still healing up.} You made it, good. I'm getting tired of waiting for you - and Elijah. {Beat} Surprised? Yeah... I made it here, just like you did. {<Player made it through the Suites, Hated. Christine's voice is back, although it's ragged, it just healed.>}
{Relieved, voice thick from surgery} You made it, good... <Coughs>ugh.. {Winces}Hurts to talk. I'll keep this quick in case my... voice goes out.
{Frowns, a little defeated}You're back. You sure you still want me here, collars and all? {To herself, rueful} Not much for waiting around with a bomb around my neck. {Christine was not pleased to be asked to wait. Urges the player to find whatever he/she needs of her.}
I... {coughs} I wish you luck in the Vault. Elijah... he's tough to pin down. {Christine's voice is restored, wishes the player luck in the vault.}
[Christine is looking at the Fountain, her eyes narrowed. She then scans the courtyard perimeter, gauging the distance.]
[She glances at your wrist, then back at the Fountain.]
[The woman before you looks disoriented, pained - she blinks a few times, then winces, as if the act of blinking causes her pain.]
[Christine points at the sky, makes a fist, then makes an explosion gesture with her fingers.]
[Christine shakes her head, narrows her eyes, then points at your compass.]
[Christine motions to you, points at the door uneasily, then makes a pulling motion with her hand. She seems hesitant to go near it.]
{Return Greeting, Neutral}[Christine looks at you warily.]
{Return Greeting, Disliked}[Christine glares at you.]
{Return Greeting, Liked}[Christine raises an eyebrow.]
[Christine glances at the elevator, her expression becomes worried, then she looks back at you, then reluctantly shakes her head.]
[She circles her finger around the Fountain and moves her fingers and thumb together rapidly, as if talking.]
[She frowns, stops moving her hand, then points at the Pip-Boy at your wrist.]
{Slight surprise} Surprised that Super Mutant didn't eat you... {under her breath} and don't get me started on Dean.
{Takes a breath, rests tone, beat} So... I just rasp out some words, and the vault opens? {Beat, to herself} That woman, the starlet... she didn't build this place, why would the builder do that?
I know. The sealed doors, the security... it's almost a fortress. Think that's why we're being ordered to come here and crack it open?
{Player has no companion, Christine comes along.}[Christine nods, and steps slightly behind you, waiting.]
{Cold} Guess the Sierra Madre healed me. {Dismissive} It doesn't matter, and to be honest, I miss {emph} my voice.
I've had enough of you and Elijah running the show. {Beat}Now it's my turn.
{Glances at medical computer}Yeah, still functional. Lot of garbage data on it, its basic procedures should still work fine.
{Slightly impressed} Looks like you got almost everything, not much more {emph} I can extract... {slight smile}"doctor." {Not mocking at the end, she's impressed, means "doctor" as a casual compliment.}
{Operating a terminal, hunting through folders} I can see... check the root, recent diagnostics...
Lot of Med-X was dispensed for... Vera Keyes. {To herself,}Guess that's her corpse there for certain... and why all those meds are scattered around in here.
...here's the medical report. {Scanning, somber} Looks like she had some sort of terminal condition... diagnosis isn't conclusive, {to herself} must have been painful.
I'm not even sure she knew, if these medical reports are enough. She must have been numb most of the time.
{Nods} All right. {Beat} Just glad I can {emph} answer you now.
{Slight frustration} No... they run a lot deeper than that.
{Quiet, unpleasant memory}While I was hunting Elijah in the Big Empty, he trapped me in one of those medical research centers buried there.
{Uncomfortable} It... did something to my head... and I got off lucky. It's difficult enough to read now, and somehow the leap between what's in my head and words...
...it just ends up being a mish-mash of symbols, not letters. Can still do math, formulas, equations... {rueful} writing poetry's out.
{Unpleasant memories, cont.}Yeah... I saw records of other "patients," and what had been done to them. Some couldn't hear anything but static. Others, just... gibbering wrecks.
Never going back... and Elijah was on his way here, so I couldn't stop to see if it was something I could fix...
...if you can even fix what happened to me when they jabbed the electrodes into my skull and turned my head into a flashlight.
{Sighs} Then I got here, and my voice got severed... now I have a new one. {Grim}Another thing Elijah has to answer for.
{Emph, incredulous} Dean? {Beat, echoing disbelief} Dean {Emph} Domino?
Why would he want to torture me? {More to herself} If he wanted to do that, he could keep his singing career going... or keep staring at me.
{Recognition, matter-of-fact}The elevator to the casino vault is here. In the starlet's room? That seems intimate.
What? {Frowns} Open something... {beat} my voice. That's why it's hers... someone wanted to use me as a key.
All right, I can do that... hope you're ready.
Too long. Thought I might have had a chance to settle it before this event happened, but then the chance slipped away again.
{Reluctant} Wasn't sure until now I could trust you. Now I know. {< voice is restored. Christine says she didn't know who she could trust. Thinks player is worth keeping around. >}
Look, when I woke up here... however that happened... I had this key on me - I think it belongs to her.
Haven't had a chance to use it yet - might open the dresser, or the safe - didn't have time to experiment with it before you arrived. Here you go.
{Reluctant} Wasn't sure until now I could trust you. Now I know. {< voice is restored. Christine says she didn't know who she could trust. Thinks player is worth keeping around. >}
He... cut me off from someone I cared about a long time ago. He used his status to break us apart. So I had to find a new purpose, same banner.
Then he became unstable, left a trail of crimes across the wasteland. Once word reached us, I was ordered to kill him.
To the vault... of course. {Nods} That makes sense.
{DUPE} An audio-lock to where? {Beat, recognizes what happened} To the Sierra Madre vault. It's voice-activated. And he wanted in.
{DUPE} That makes sense. {Thinking} So... those bodies in the Clinic... all right. Dean always felt like the odd one out, and he kept... studying me.
{Confused} Do I? {Shakes head} It sounds off to my ears... hard to tell. Not to mention it... hurts like hell to swallow.
Might be why I got moved off to this suite... it's hers. {Quiet}That's her over there, got trapped by security like I did. Just took a different way out. {Thinking. In second part, referring to the skeleton in the bedroom with her, dead.}
[Christine smiles slightly in relief, and nods. She opens her mouth slightly, then closes it, frustrated.]
[She points at you, then makes a fist and puts it against her chest and nods.]
[Christine smiles slightly in relief, and moves to the elevator.]
{Cold} Those are my orders. I've seen what he's done, and I believe in those orders.
[Christine nods gratefully. She glances in the direction of the terminal, looks at you, smiles, gives a thumbs up.]
[Christine shakes her head, more insistently this time. She points at the elevator, then downwards, then holds herself tightly and shakes her head.]
[She looks at you, blinks again, then opens her mouth - but nothing comes out.]
[She touches her throat, then traces the scar beneath the chin, and her eyes widen in alarm.]
[She looks shaken. As she glances at the Auto-Doc, she recoils, and her mouth opens - but again, nothing comes out.]
[She looks back at you, and her hands clench into fists - her eyes narrow, and she takes a step back, studying you.]
[The woman opens her mouth again, winces, then frowns and drags a finger across her throat in a slow motion. She looks more angry than pained now.]
[Frowning, she touches her throat again, gently, then her hand brushes her collar, then her frown deepens.]
[Her eyes narrow as she traces the edge of the collar until she finds the lock. She begins to press it with her fingers.]
[She looks surprised. Then notices your collar, and raises an eyebrow.]
[She frowns, narrows her eyes, then slowly shakes her head.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She nods... slowly, then puts her hand in front her throat, closes it slowly, then points at you.]
[FAILED] [She frowns, narrows her eyes, and looks at you.]
[She shakes her head again and draws a line in the air between the two of you.]
[She shakes her head - once, then crosses her arms.]
[Christine glances straight up, frowns, then turns back to you and taps her wrist.]
[She looks exasperated, then waves her hand in a circle in front of her.]
[She raises an eyebrow, then tilts her head slightly.]
[She frowns, then cups her hand to her ear.]
[She shakes her head... then pauses, and shakes her head again, then looks exasperated.]
[Christine looks blankly at you. Then touches her head, smiles, then shakes her head.]
[She waves her hand, then shakes her head - she then nods in the direction of the casino.]
[She nods with an exasperated look, then makes a circle with her hands, repeats it twice more, then raises her hands and waves them like wings.]
[She puts both hands in front of her, then makes a motion with her hands as if writing something.]
[She nods. She looks impressed.]
[She shrugs. Then she points to you and shrugs.]
[She shakes her head.]
[She touches one of the scars on her cheeks, shakes head. Then touches the scar on her neck, and nods.]
[Christine nods.]
[She shivers slightly, and shakes her head.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, and raises her hands, palms facing each other, then rotates in a 180 degree arc and back again.]
[FAILED] [She rolls her eyes, opens her mouth to speak, then stops, her face tensing up in frustration.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, looks impressed.]
[FAILED] [She shakes her head, then nods in the direction of the casino again.]
{Deliver this angrier, seems like a dupe, isn't} The Gala went off, the Switching Station opened up - thought the screeching in the Auto-Doc was bad, Station worse.
Got outside, saw the light show, and it was enough to make me run to the casino.
Also... it seemed like the lights and speakers were helping to guide me... guess your master wanted a back-up in case you died.
As for being assigned to this floor... maybe it's because of my new voice. Your guess is as good as mine. {Beat, sarcastic} Maybe it recognized me as a guest.
[She moves her finger in a wider circle, then raises her hand over her eyes.]
{Skeptical} It's possible. This place is immense... and it still has power, food dispensers, security... was it all for Pre-War guests? {Beat} Or for her?
[She moves her finger in a circle, frowns, then drags her hand down over her eyes. She raises them again, points to you.]
[Her eyes widen, and her eyes gauge yours. She then touches her wounds, and her expression crumbles into anger, as if defeated. She slowly nods.]
{Nods} All right. {Cold, she knows she may be trapping the player down here} If you go down there, are you prepared... what if you don't come back? {Christine is asking, because she knows that Elijah will show up, and when he does, she's going to suicide and kill him.}
{Player has no companion. Christine comes along.}[Christine narrows her eyes slightly. She slowly nods, then steps slightly behind you.]
{Player has a companion. Christine goes to the fountain for now.} [Christine glances at your follower, shakes her head, then points at you, her, and nods in the direction of the fountain.]
{Evasive} I... just wanted to make sure you're ready. When you go down there, that may be it for us... we won't be needed anymore.
The one who made these collars, he'll follow you down there. And he won't let you leave. He's not one for sharing, never was.
[Christine's defeated expression vanishes into a stone-faced glare.]
[She taps the collar and then opens and closes her hand really fast.]
[She taps her collar, then opens and closes her hand really fast.]
[She points at your Pip-Boy, her collar, and then your collar. After a second, then she opens and closes her hand slower.]
[She points at your collar, then hers, then nods at your Pip-Boy. She makes a triangle motion, then the same slow pulse as before with her fingers.]
{To herself} Love makes people do strange things. {Beat, quiet} Won't argue that. It can drive you crazy sometimes if you can't... connect.
{Reluctant, something's wrong} If they loved each other, and they were together... I suppose that's all that mattered.
But she's in that side room, dead, because the casino wouldn't let her leave. {Beat}And who knows where he is.
{Christine goes to the fountain.} [Christine gives a brief nod, then turns and begins to walk.]
[She frowns, glances at the collar, looks back at you. She makes a circle with her hands, puts her hand over her eyes and squints.]
[She nods at you, then lowers her hand from her eyes, shakes her head. She draws a slow line between you.]
[She studies you again, then her expression softens slightly. She shakes her head slowly, and gives a silent sigh.]
[She nods at you, then raises an eyebrow and nods at the door.]
He saw me, before the scars, at a place far from here. It's where he found some of the technology he uses now.
{Remembering a bad experience, somber} It's a place called the Big Empty. The name's deceptive - if you know where to look.
{Still reflecting} Almost got trapped there. There was someone else, though, who came along. Knew about Elijah.
{Curious} You did? {Impressed} Looks like even the Old World can't keep you out when you've got a mind to get in.
No idea. A courier. Wore an Old World flag on his back. He was the one who pulled me out there, told me where Elijah had gone.
{Reflective} Helped me heal up, listened to my story. He... sympathized.
He said he understood what it meant to track someone who had such a... impact on his past life.
He said people were like couriers, sometimes never understanding the messages they brought. {Frowns} That's who he was hunting for... some courier.
{Disgusted} Try and reason with him, see what happens. He's so lost in his technology, I don't think he even understands why anymore.
{Slight irritation} Fine. {Warning player} I hear my collar beeping though, I've got the route to the exit all mapped out.
[She nods... then gestures at your hand, offers hers.]
[She holds it, meeting your eyes intently for a few moments. She gives your hand a gentle squeeze, then releases it and smiles slightly.]
[She frowns, then waves you away and focuses on the terminal.]
[She narrows her eyes, determined, and gives a last nod.]
[She tries to open her mouth and nothing comes out. Her eyes narrow and her hands ball into fists.]
[She touches her collar, then shakes her head in frustration and nods at you to go ahead.]
[Christine tilts her head slightly, glances at your collar, then your Pip-Boy. She opens her mouth, frowns, then closes it.]
[Her face looks sad, and she taps her chest once, slowly. She nods at you, then the exit.]
[Christine takes a step back from your gaze... her eyes widen in alarm, she takes one step, then two toward the elevator.]
[Christine studies the elevator frame, raises her hands... then sets them down... then raises them up again.]
[She gives a silent sigh of exasperation, and frowns at the elevator, and her hand brushes the side of her face, tracing the scar.]
[She turns to you, relieved, and nods... then she turns away, and her face crumbles. She makes motions with her fingers, then clenches her fists.]
[Her face becomes angry. She points at the elevator, points downward, then wraps her arms around her and shakes her head.]
{To herself} "Begin again, but know when to let go." {Shakes head, skeptical} Let's see what happens. {Christine now knows what she needs to say at the Vault Elevator. She will start heading toward it at the end of the sentence, to bark the password i}
I... can't let him leave here. Look, you've done so much, and he's not going to show himself until you go down there.
[SUCCEEDED] I...
[FAILED] No... no, you have it wrong. Look, it's now or never, all right? Let me open the elevator. {She's lying in this node.}
I can't let go. Every time I've thought about it...
{Quiet} I've lost him so many times. He needs to die... what happened here, with us? {Doesn't want to think about it}He's... he's done so much worse.
I know. And he {pause} will kill me, I can't get the collar off. Even if I could, I need to be sure - see his eyes, his face, when he dies.
{Quiet} You have to promise me. Promise me you'll deal with him... if I see him, I...
{Quiet} I can't. It's my mission, has been. {Beat} This has to be done.
I... I didn't want this to happen. {Sighs} Ending him is more important than saving you. For what it's worth... I'm sorry.
{Hopeful, slight} All right. All right, I'll... {frowns} but I'll need to leave this floor. He'll pick up my collar, and...
{Nods, sighs} I... {takes a breath} never mind. Let me get the vault open... {To herself, slowly, quiet as if memorizing it} "Begin again... but know when to let go." {Slight rueful laugh, to player}Sounds like you. {Say this a little tenderly, the player just talked her down from suicide, and Christine's found new purpose.}
[She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
[FAILED] [She frowns, shakes her head.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
[FAILED] [She frowns, shakes her head.]
[She frowns, slowly shakes her head - she opens her mouth, then makes the motion of tuning a dial, then points at herself.]
[She nods, and motions for you to go ahead.]
[She nods, once, then again, points at the two of you, then the Pip-Boy.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
[FAILED] [She frowns, shakes her head.]
[She looks puzzled for a second, then glares at you and motions you to move on.]
[Christine holds out her hand, and motions at your Pip-Boy.]
[Christine studies the Pip-Boy intently, turning your arm around as if your wrist's a sensor module she just found.]
[She doesn't seem interested in the screen - she studies the exterior, then the casing. She seems to be making sure it's intact.]
[She frowns, and snaps her fingers at your Pip-Boy.]
[Christine snarls, makes a dismissive wave, and goes back to studying the Fountain intently - then looks at the casino, then the Fountain again.]
[Christine shakes her head, then pauses, and makes a small circle with her thumb and forefinger.]
[She points at you, and makes the motion of putting something in her palm.]
[Her finger stabs through the red buttons, narrowing in on the local map. She scrolls to the Sierra Madre's main gate, frowns, backs out.]
[She calls up the local map of the Puesta del Sol Switching Station, zooms in. Her intent expression loses some of its edge as she notes the marker.]
[She looks up at you, points at marker on your Pip-Boy, points West and tilts her head.]
[She points at the Fountain, then at your Pip-Boy... pauses, then points at her collar, then yours.]
[She encircles her throat with her hand, then slowly releases it. Then she motions again to the West.]
[She frowns, then makes a motion as if typing at keys... then she points at you, raises her left wrist and pantomimes talking into it.]
[She points at you, then her, looks right and left, raises two fingers, tries to type, pauses, and slowly shakes her head.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She slowly nods, looks impressed.]
[FAILED] [She sighs silently, then shakes her head and motions to the West.]
[She sighs silently, then shakes her head and motions to the West.]
[She nods, then waits.]
[She surveys the area, focusing upwards. She glances at the casino, frowns. She then looks West, then East.]
[She glares at you. After a second, she pauses, and smiles slightly, shaking her head. She then makes a circle of the skyline with her finger.]
[She examines the chip for a second, raises it to her eye, then turns it to the side, gauging its diameter and width.]
[She runs her finger over the surface slowly, checking the engraving. She then tosses the chip back to you.]
[She then pretends to look around, sees something on the floor, then pretends to bend down and pick it up. She then looks at you and nods.]
[She frowns, shakes her head.]
[She frowns, shakes her head.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She smiles, nods.]
[FAILED] [She frowns, looks frustrated for a moment, thinking.]
[She frowns, looks frustrated for a moment, thinking.]
[She stands still for a second, then stops, and slowly makes the motion of bending down and scooping something up.]
[Then she holds the imaginary object in her hand, as if heavy, and puts it in front of her, as if on a table.]
[She then hefts what looks like a small box, and pours it on top of the object, looks at it, then reaches down and holds up a small "O."]
[Christine points at your pack, then points at the Fission Battery and the Scrap Metal.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She smiles, nods.]
[She points at your Pip-Boy, makes a motion of opening it up and removing something from it.]
[She then raises her hand and makes the motion of smashing it and holding up the remains.]
[FAILED] [She frowns, then thinks for a moment. She then points at your pack, and taps the back of her wrist.]
Thought you'd leave me in that elevator? {Slow anger, remembering how the player trapped her} I haven't forgotten what you did in the Switching Station, not for a second.
Trapped down in that room in the dark, listening to that {emph} sound, like saw blades. {Cold, anger} I could barely breathe... couldn't even scream!
{Quiet, more to herself} Was like being operated on in that Auto-Doc in the Clinic... all over again.
Come to throw me in the Auto-Doc? Toss me back in the Clinic where you found me?
Did you know the Stimpak reservoirs ran out within an hour of being in there? I was in there for two weeks, and it kept... repeating the procedure.
{Disgust} No Med-X, no stims, just... that {emph} sound, feeling the scalpels... cut. {Cold} Now... we're going to see how you like it when someone else is in control. {Med-X, stims are healing items, and Christine didn't have any, very painful. Now is going to make player pay.}
I can switch the proximity of the detonation frequency. Try and run? I'll have the signal seek you out, blow up your collar from a distance.
Come in close, maybe get the upper hand? I'll set off the proximity detonator, and your collar'll blow.
[She points at the casino, makes a movement with her hands as if talking, and then repeats the squinting gesture.]
[Christine waits, studying you.]
[She nods, impressed. Then she points at you, then her and makes a circle.]
[She nods. She then makes a series of hand motions to represent weight and amounts - enough so you think you could do it on your own.]
When we first met, I thought I recognized the collar technology. Just needed some time to experiment with it.
I noticed the signal lag as soon as you arrived on the floor. Collar detonator signal's down to a dull thud, more like a heartbeat than a screech.
You think you can kill me, then make a run for the exit before my dead man's signal catches you and blows that collar. {Beat, player walked into trap}Not gonna be that easy.
The Suites here gave me enough tools and enough time that our frequencies... I can push and pull that collar of yours however I want.
{Cold, determined} Silence suits me fine. When your master shows, I'll deal with him, too. {< Christine talks smack back and starts the fight. "Master" is delivered with disgust.>}
[SUCCEEDED] I did. And it means I can control your movements.
[FAILED] {DUPE} You'll find out.
[SUCCEEDED] Oh, it helps... as long as I need to control your movements.
[FAILED] Free? I have more freedom of movement than you do, and that's all I need.
You'll find out.
Try and run, it won't matter, the signal will find you. Get too close to me, then the signal'll lock on. You can't get away.
[SUCCEEDED] [Christine frowns, then pauses and traces one of the scars on her head with her finger.]
[She then makes a motion as if picking up a pencil, tries to write, then shakes her head.]
[FAILED] [Christine nods, frowns, then points at you, then points West. Then she glares at you.]
{Slightly uneasy, player is right} We'll see. I don't think you're gonna have the time.
You, Elijah... it doesn't matter. Both of you have run out of places to hide.
[SUCCEEDED] No, I believe you. All along, you were watching out for yourself. I understand. {A little softer here, for a second, Christine is going to pass along some wisdom before the player dies.}
But I wonder what you would have done if there hadn't been these collars. Would you have gotten me out of the Clinic at all?
So as long as we're "in this together," and it's a choice between you and me? I know what you're going to choose.
I'm not gonna wait for that to happen - again. I'm tired of being controlled.
[FAILED] I believe you. And that's not the point. That collar... I believe you got caught by Elijah, too. I don't think it changes who you are.
How you behaved in the Villa... all that was you. And as bad as these collars are, maybe it kept you from being {emph} worse.
And that's the worst part about all this. That it takes something like that to keep you from hurting someone else.
{Disbelieving} Dean? {Emph}He put me in there? No, I don't believe it. He didn't have any reason to torture me. You, on the other hand...
An audio-lock to where? {Beat, recognizes what happened} To the Sierra Madre vault. It's voice-activated. And he wanted in.
That makes sense. {Thinking}So... those bodies in the Clinic... all right. Dean always felt like the odd one out, and he kept... studying me. {Chewing it over, slight disgust at end.}
He was trying to figure out if I recognized him... and see if my throat healed. I'll deal with you first, then I'll deal with him.
[She pauses, then draws a jagged symbol like electricity in the air, then puts on an odd, staring face.]
[She keeps the blank face for a second, then slowly blinks, looks around. She looks at her hands, shakes them, then lets them go limp.]
[She shakes her head... then stops, as if thinking.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, slowly, and then makes the motion of typing and drawing X's and lines in the air, and then gives a thumbs up.]
[FAILED] [She looks distant... then slowly shakes her head.]
[She nods, smiles.]
[She nods.]
[She nods. She raises an eyebrow, points at you, makes a circle, then points at your feet.]
[Christine looks at you, frowns. Then glances at the casino, her eyes narrowed. She stops breathing for a second, as if holding it in.]
[She ignores you for a second, still staring at the casino. Then she glances at you, and her face and stance relax slightly.]
[She points at her collar, then the casino with an irritated look. She then folds her arms and raises an eyebrow.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She looks like she's about to shake her head, stops, and then puts her hand over her eyes and squints, as if staring in the distance.]
[FAILED] [She glares at you a moment, then slowly shakes her head.]
[SUCCEEDED] {DUPE} [She looks like she's about to shake her head, stops, and then puts her hand over her eyes and squints, as if staring in the distance.]
[FAILED] [She glares at you a moment, then slowly shakes her head.]
{Grim, shakes head} I've... done worse. Much worse... and for more hopeless causes, and I will again.
[She nods.]
[She wrinkles her face, frowns, and looks angry. She touches her throat, traces the scar with her finger, then points the finger at the casino.]
[She then points at your collars, points at the casino. Then she matches your gaze with a dark expression, then draws a slow line across her throat.]
[She gives a nod. Then another nod, even slower.]
[She nods grimly. She seems satisfied.]
[Christine's expression relaxes slightly, and she nods.]
[Christine's expression becomes furious, and she raises her hands, draws jagged lines in the air.]
[She then points at you, then the direction of the casino, and makes the motion of two hands talking to each other.]
[As one hand continues to talk, she moves the other hand to the wrist, and constricts until the other hand slows, stops talking.]
[Christine looks at you, then shakes her head, points at your collar, then the front gate and shakes her head.]
[She then slowly shakes her head and draws an "X" in the air.]
[She then slowly shakes her head and draws an "X" in the air.]
[She looks at you for a moment, studying you. She doesn't move. After a second or two, she frowns.]
[She frowns, glances at your feet, then nods. She then raises an eyebrow, points at you, makes a circle, then points at your feet.]
[She continues to look at you for a moment, studying you, then her eyes fall to your collar, then your Pip-Boy.]
[She glances back up at you, then she circles herself and points at the ground between you.]
[She repeats the circling motion again. This time, she lowers her hand and circles her finger inward, until she's pointing at the spot between you.]
[Still pointing at the ground between you two, she raises an eyebrow.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She smiles, nods.]
[FAILED] [She makes a mock sigh.]
[She waits. After a second, she raises her eyebrow again.]
[She shrugs, then taps the back of her palm in the direction of the Fountain.]
[She shrugs, then taps the back of her palm, pointing West and down.]
[Almost against her will, she smiles. After a moment, the smile fades, and she points at the ground again.]
[She looks at you for a second, studying you. Then nods.]
[She points at you, then points at the casino, and she slowly shakes her head - then points in the direction of the main gate.]
[She frowns, puts her hands on her hips and glares at you. After a second, she rolls her eyes.]
[She then makes a mocking, slow intake of breath, and then winces. Then she glances at you, points in the direction of main gate.]
[She looks at you for a moment, glances at your collar, shrugs. She then lightly grabs her neck with both hands, holds it for a moment.]
[Then her hands fall away. She looks at you, looks at the exit and nods.]
[She slowly shakes her head, then points at the ground.]
[She frowns. Glances in the direction of the casino, then the exit, then back in the direction of the casino.]
[She shrugs... without strength or conviction. She isn't looking at you when she does.]
[She points in the direction of the main gate. Then points at your collar, shakes her head, and locks her hands around her neck.]
[Then her hands lash outwards, fingers splayed and she rolls her eyes back. After a second she turns back to you shakes her head.]
[She nods slowly, as if thinking. Then she raises an eyebrow, looks skeptical, then shrugs.]
[She points downwards, makes a circle around her, then back to the same spot... and then her finger drifts, circling, and she makes a mock-frown.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She shakes her head, points at herself, then points at you, nods.]
[FAILED] [She looks frustrated, then makes a dismissive wave.]
[She shakes her head and rolls her eyes.]
[She nods.]
[She nods once.]
[She slowly shakes her head. She points at the ground, then moves each leg outward, straddling the place where she's pointing.]
[She nods.]
[She frowns, shakes her head... pauses... then tilts her head slightly, nods slowly.]
[She frowns, makes a mock motion of loading a gun, then hefting it to her shoulder and taking aim at something in the distance.]
[Then she pauses, makes a sweeping circle, then puts her arms in a circle around it, as if covering it.]
[Shakes her head and makes a motion of two fingers walking.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She looks impressed, nods.]
[FAILED] [She looks frustrated, then makes a dismissive wave.]
[She looks at you, as if surprised. Then glances at your collar, wrinkles her face, and points at it.]
[She makes a wide sweeping circle of the area, looking around... then brings both hands back to her, then to her neck, and holds it.]
[Her hands still on her neck, she looks at you gravely, then shakes her head.]
[She nods slowly, hands still locked on her throat. She looks pained for a moment, and she breaks from your gaze.]
[Her fingers flutter, almost frantically, for a second, and she runs her hands along her scalp, then her throat - then the collar.]
[She points at your Pip-Boy, almost with frustration... then gestures all around her, and her shoulders seem to sag.]
[After a moment, she glances back at you, glances around her, then shakes her head slowly.]
[She points at your collar, then hers, and shakes her head slowly... then cuts the air with her hand and her face becomes blank.]
[She gives you a snarl, glances at your collar, makes a dismissive wave.]
[She smiles humorlessly. She then nods once slowly. Then she shakes her head slowly.]
[She then looks at you, her face wrinkled in a humorless smile.]
[SUCCEEDED] [Her face wrinkles more, and then she gives a reluctant smile.]
[FAILED] [She looks frustrated, then makes a dismissive wave.]
[She nods and raises a finger.]
[Still smiling, she rolls her eyes, and then slowly taps the back of her wrist.]
[She looks at you, surprised. Then she opens her mouth as if to laugh... silently.]
[Almost as soon as she utters her silent laugh, she stops, looks pained, and her expression becomes dark.]
[She doesn't look at you, continues to stare darkly in front of her.]
[After a moment, she glances at you, then taps the back of her wrist. She nods in front of her.]
[She shakes her head and rolls her eyes.]
[She frowns and raises her middle finger.]
[She shakes her head and pumps her fist near her chest.]
[She nods. She makes a motion with her hands around her chin, drawing it down, and then she raises her hands and clenches them at the sky.]
[She shakes her head... then stops mid-way, frowns... then tilts her head, as if thinking. She seems lost in thought for a moment.]
[She glances at you, as if caught, then she smiles slightly, but there's an edge to it. Then she shakes her head, slowly, once.]
{SCRIPT: Knows that Elijah is in Pip-Boy} [She points at your Pip-Boy.]
[She nods, looks concerned, taps the side of her head, and expands her hands.]
[She shakes her head, points at your Pip-Boy again.]
[She shakes her head, points at your Pip-Boy again and makes a talking motion with her hand.]
[She nods, then circles her ear.]
[She nods, frowns.]
[SUCCEEDED] [She frowns, raises two fingers, and has them walk together. Then she looks down on the two fingers, and her face becomes angry.]
[Then she chops her hand down, and draws the two fingers apart. One of the finger she points at herself.]
[FAILED] [She pauses, looks at you for a second, then shrugs and shakes her head.]
[She repeats the chopping motion, slower, then draws the two fingers apart. She looks sadly at one of the fingers.]
[She nods.]
[She frowns, shakes her head, and even more so at husband.]
[She hesitates, then waves her hand.]
[She shakes her head.]
[She shakes her head, but rolls it side to side.]
[She hesitates, then waves her hand.]
[She hesitates, then waves her hand.]
[She nods, and looks at you a little surprised.]
[She shakes her head, draws the two fingers together, then shakes her head more emphatically.]
[She raises an eyebrow, looks at you.]
[She nods slowly, studying you. She seems to be gauging you again.]
[She makes a slow circle motion after a moment, taps her wrist.]
{Deliver this slow, thoughtful, seems like a dupe, isn't} The Gala went off, the Switching Station opened up - {to herself, rueful} thought the screeching in the Auto-Doc was bad, Station worse.
Got outside, saw the light show, and it was enough to make me run to the casino.
Also... it seemed like the lights and speakers were helping to guide me... guess your master wanted a back-up in case you died.
As for being assigned to this floor... maybe it's because of my new voice. Your guess is as good as mine. {Beat, sarcastic} Maybe it recognized me as a guest.
[Christine draws a jagged lightning bolt in the air, pantomimes throwing a grenade, and then pulls an imaginary knife from behind her back.]
[Then she moves her feet shoulder width apart, holds hands up in a martial arts stance, then turns both hands into pistols, pantomimes rapid-firing.]
[She then holds one pistol up, takes aim as if sighting along the barrel and does a single shot, ends with a nod.]
[She nods. Once.]
[She shrugs slightly, then waits.]
[She makes a disapproving frown, shakes her head.]
{Frowns, slow} You know what... you're right. I don't need to use the same methods to kill you, and I shouldn't... it would make me as bad as Elijah is.
{Cold, low} All right - forget the proximity frequency, we'll decide this ourselves.
[Christine stops, glances at the speaker, then glances at your collar, frowning.]
{Breaks into player's frequency while he's being blasted with turrets, urgency}Seeing what I can do to shut those turrets down from up here... come on... come on... {<AUDIO: From player's bomb collar. Christine tells the player that she's trying to bring the Vault's turrets down.>}
...got it, two of 'em down... can't shut down the others - he's cut off access. {frustrated}Dammit! {Beat, cold} Put him down, bury him - whatever it takes! {<Christine succeeds in hampering the Vault's security turrets.><Christine lets the player know that two turrets are now disabled. She urges the pla}

She urges the pla}
{Hesitates, big moment}"Begin again - {slightly quieter}but know when to let go." {Christine hesitates for a moment, preparing herself to speak the password to open the Vault Elevator. A pregnant pause, then she delivers.}
[Christine studies Dean, frowns.]
[Christine shakes her head slowly.]
[Christine frowns, tilts her head slightly.]
[Christine's eyes narrow.]
[Christine eyes narrow to slits.]
[Christine taps her collar, makes a sweeping gesture at the area, then begins to pulse her fingers outward, faster and faster.] {She's indicating speakers may be nearby.}
[Christine nods at the Vending Machine, then makes a sweeping gesture with both arms and draws them to her chest.] {<After entering a room with a vending machine, Christine indicates to the player that it may be a good time to stock up on supplies>}
{Christine Dead: Narration}Christine, scarred by her hunt for Elijah and unable to let him go, perished in the Sierra Madre Casino. {This plays if Christine died. Even though narrating, keep this on the somber side.}
{Narration} She never completed her mission, nor did she stop to consider what had driven her to accept the mission in the first place. {This plays if Christine died. Even though narrating, slightly judgmental.}
{Narration} Obsession is another form of greed, a lesson that Christine never learned. {This plays if Christine died. Even though narrating, slightly judgmental and sad at the same time, as if shaking head.}
{Christine Alive: Narration}Christine, her mission complete, found new purpose as the Sierra Madre's warden. She watched over it silently - by choice. {This plays if Christine lives. Even though narrating, this ending is slightly stronger, more reverent.}
{Narration} Over time, the Ghost People came to see her as one of the Holograms. They would watch, silently, as she walked among them.
{Narration, a little tender here}At times, Christine thought of the Courier, who had kept Elijah's hand from her throat.
{Narration} The Courier reminded her of the {slight emph} other courier she had met in the Big Empty, and wondered if the two had found each other at last. {Big Empty is a location in Fallout.}
{Narration, quiet} She did not think of them again until she heard the legends of the Divide. {The Divide is another location in Fallout.}
{Slow, reverent - this is quietly dramatic, ends on a sad downnote} The Divide, where the two messengers, the two couriers, fought beneath an ancient flag, at the edge of the world. {Slow, draw this to a close. Keep this quietly dramatic. This is forecasting a horrible, tragic event to come in a future adventure.}
[You hear banging from the speaker, as if someone is hammering on a wall with their fists.]
[You hear a tapping from the speaker... a series of sharp taps, then a slow, two taps.]
[The hammering stops for a second... and there's one final bang from the speaker, as if someone is smashing their fist into a wall.]
[A single tap comes from the speaker, then silence.]
[Christine narrows her eyes, gets into a combat stance.]
[Christine frowns.]
[Christine flicks her finger back and forth quickly like a switch, then nods to the north.] {<Indicates to the player that the Switching Station is to the north>}
[Christine frowns, looks upward, then back at you. She nods her head upwards, then makes the motion of holding a gun at the ready.] {<Indicates that it might be safer to find higher ground>}
[Christine's eyes dart around at the walls and the ceiling. She glances at the exit, then takes a slow breath. Sweat appears on her brow.] {<When entering a small underground room Christine indicates that she doesn't like small spaces and would prefer to be above ground>}
[Christine's eyes dart in the direction of the screeching sound. She looks frightened and trembles slightly, as if fighting an urge to run.]
[Christine frowns, points at your collar, then hers.]
[Christine points at mine, then taps her temple.]
[Christine covers her ears.]
{Cold, determined} Silence suits me fine. When your master shows, I'll deal with him, too. {< Christine talks smack back and starts the fight. "Master" is delivered with disgust.>}
{Takes a breath} I've been hunting the one who hijacked your Pip-Boy, Elijah, for... some time. {< voice is restored. Christine tells the player about her mission to kill Elijah. >}
{Deadly serious} He {emph}cannot leave the Sierra Madre alive. What he's done... what he's done here is nothing compared to what he's done in the past.
The only way to bring him out is if you get to the vault... he won't allow you to go down there {emph} alone. That's when we kill him.
{Studies player, thinks the player is worth it} Good luck. He's... not an easy opponent. If I can, I'll help. {Beat, thinking} Might be able to figure something out using the Sierra Madre's computer systems. {< voice is restored. Christine wishes the player good luck and walks over to the intercom to disable security. >}

I hear you.
You sure? I mean... look, you can't just tell me to walk now, you know. That's... well, not very friendly.
{Relieved} That's a relief. {Beat, changes tone to false confidence} I-I mean, not like I care. I'm fine on my own.
I can't say it hasn't been fun... {quiet} well, I can, but I'll save it for my memoirs.
Lose the second-stringer, and I'll make the time.
Strike up the band, Domino's back in town.
Music to my ears.
{Dismissive} Get a porter, carrying someone's bags - not my style.
{Quiet, to himself} This crouching's hell on my knees.
{Curious, suspicious} Tactics? What, we going to get into a shootout soon, or...?
Style's not something you just change, friend.
{Scoffs} Yeah, right. {Beat} Oh, you're serious. You bet.
{Slight irriation} Sure, let's jaw all day and all night, why not?
If that's all, let's shake a leg.
Boxing's not really my thing. I prefer the gentle touch... but all right, it's your show.
{Relieved} All you, trust me.
{Nods, totally lying} I'll be sure to cover you, don't you worry.
You're the one who dragged me out of my apartment, so yeah, I'm keeping close. So what?
{Nods} Like dancing with your shadow.
All right.
Enough gum-flapping, Madre's not getting any younger.
{Rolls eyes} Oh, you bet. I'll flank them... might take me a while, though, so you just hold tight.
Fine. "Tactics" means "stay out of sight" around here anyway.
{Eager} Let's deal.
{Nods, but slight worry} Don't be long.
{Cold, menacing} So you showed. Felt the collar start kicking again as soon as the elevator doors rattled open. {<THEATER: Dean greets Player at the Theater (Hates Player opener). Dean is about to spring a trap once the convo is done: Holograms around Player>}
Think you're going to up-stage me, here at the Sierra Madre? I don't think so. Now that I'm inside... well, I don't need you anymore.
{Calls out, a little nervous, but relieved} Finally, a friendly face... hey! Partner! Up here. {<THEATER: Dean greets Player at the Theater (Likes Player opener). Dean is hiding in the backstage, and will need the Player's help to get out.>}
{Uncomfortable, like someone standing in a mine field} In a bit of a predicament here... had to duck backstage, take a powder, the audience is a little... {frowns} murderous tonight. {Dean is hemmed in by lethal security holograms.}
{Cold, menacing} All right, you're resourceful, I'll give you that - it's going to take a lot more than juggling keys and shooting speakers to stop me. {<THEATER: Dean greets Player (Hate opener) after the Holograms are gone, and the backstage is accessible. Dean will fight player, unless persuaded>}
As I see it? All I need to do is kill you, then make a run for the exit. You do the same, you'll be clawing at the lock until your head blows off.
So maybe you and I should have a little chat - just like we did when you first waltzed into town.
{Relieved} Those electric ghosts aren't the kind of audience I like at the best of times - {to himself} at least the ones in the Villa had manners. {<THEATER: Dean greets Player (Like opener) after Holograms are gone. Dean will give his safe key, and entertainer pass, to Player.>}
{Frowns, looking around} Don't even know how I ended up here... guess the casino still recognizes guests even after all this time, huh? {Snorts} How's that for history.
{Under his breath, relieved, after battle in the theater} Not going to be performing {emph} here again, that's for sure. This place is a dump! Lousy acoustics. {<THEATER: Dean Greet/Bye Bark, if he was dealt with peacefully.>}
{Player tries to talk in the middle of combat} Not now, we got bigger problems.
{Just heard Elijah booming over the radio} Was that him floating above the Fountain, the boss man? The one who put these bowties on our necks?
{Uneasy} Sure does like to make a presentation... wish he'd keep it down, or else the Ghost People are going to swarm the gates, Vera Hologram or no.
{Player hasn't talked to Dean for the first time and isn't in his seat} Have a seat, and then we'll talk.
The Sierra Madre. {Smiles, slightly amused}Mmm... beauty, isn't she. She the one who invited you here?
Or maybe you didn't catch her voice on the radio. {"You"} Woke up, confused, like some of the others. {Pauses, shrugs} Least {emph}you're still breathing.
{Confidentially} By the way, don't get up or make any sudden motions, no matter how uncomfortable that chair gets... the cushion's just for show.
{Doesn't like player} I'll hold up my end, don't you worry. {To himself} We get to the Sierra Madre, it'll be a different tune, trust me.
{Irritated, basically asked to be a roadie} "Hold the wires, Dean." {Beat} Talk about being a second stringer.
{At Gala position - Studying a barren rooftop with sparking wires} So {emph} this is where I'm supposed to put on the show? {Beat, mumbling}Played better venues, let me tell you.
{Studying wiring along the roof} What's that there... wiring? Looks... {frowns} looks like it's tied to the sound system in the Villa, {looks down} except for that snipped section there.
{Frowns} So... what, I stand here, hold the two ends in my hands, and tap them together like cymbals?
{Dean likes the player} Didn't think much of our chances, now I'm thinking I was wrong. What's the next step?
{Dean hates the player} Well, now, if it isn't my ball, chain, and dog collar rolled all into one.
{Dean's neutral to the player} You have that sad, questioning look in your eye. Not sure talking to me's going to make it any better.
What, you need surgery done? Let's get out of here... those speakers on the wall are making my nerves do a dance. {Player keeps going deeper into the clinic, and Dean doesn't want Christine (a victim he put here) found.}
{Not really happy to hear this, it's like someone left his door unlocked in a dangerous neighborhood} Oh, looks like you already forced the gate. {Beat, under his breath} Now, everybody and their mother can walk right in, thanks.
Watch for Hologram security, not as nice as the lady at the fountain, trust me.
{Confused} What are we doing here? {Sarcastic} We're not going to find a doctor on call at this hour, trust me. {Player has entered the medical district. Confusion, then uneasy sarcasm.}
{Uneasy, not because of ghosts, but finding his victim, Christine} Place is haunted, got ghosts walking in it.
{Paranoia sets in} Look... I give you this key, and there's nothing to keep you from just killing me and running. And as I see it...
{Quiet resolution} ...I just gave up my ace in the hole. So... the only chance I've got left is making sure you don't leave.
And there's no way in hell I'm letting you get to the Sierra Madre vault instead of me. Not after all this time.
It's a shame... I regret it. Still, you dames are all the same - things get a little hot, you get cold feet. That's why I'm still alive. You? Well...
{Chewing it over} Supposed to be the Grand Opening of the Sierra Madre. Lot of lights, music, the works.
{Slowly} And he's going to use the Gala Event... to open the casino? But... {Thinking} that's... interesting.
{Disdainful} You don't just stop robbing casinos, do you? What's that tape... oh, the one with Sinclair's woman, Vera.
{Disdainful} What about it? You want me to give you a standing ovation?
Always asking questions when you should be shooting. You're a piece of work, I'll give you that.
Unless you get some Hologram guards lit up in the courtyard below? No dice.
{Like told to wait in a DMZ} Whoa, whoa, whoa... in the middle of town here? Alone? On a {emph} rooftop, with a big lightshow in the air? {<Dean doesn't want to stay in a DMZ with zombies all around.>}
{Sarcastic} Tell you what - why don't you just find one of those Cosmic steak knives so I can slit my wrists, be less {emph} painful checking out that way.
Yeah - don't you? Or... {Frowns} guess Vera Keyes got lost along with the rest of the holo-archives when the bomb hit, huh?
{Little wistful} Ghost in name and image. Still a looker, though. {Quiet} Got to hand it to Sinclair, sure can pick 'em. Well, or get picked. Whichever.
[SUCCEEDED] {Bluffing, slightly uneasy} Lucky guess... you sure about that? Because if you make a mistake... well, Sierra Madre's got us both.
[FAILED] Yeah, you're a gambler. Me, I don't take chances. Trust me, only {emph} one of us has a sure out.
{Relieved} Yeah, now. Talk about a captive audience. {Frowns, thinking it over} Or captive entertainer? Eh - whatever. {<Dean gives key to his safe - where supplies, and Vera's Holotape are found. He also gives the Entertainer Pass, to open Theater up. Thanks.>}
Might be a bit rude, but that chair you're sitting in - it's got a shaped charge in the seat cushion.
[SUCCEEDED] {Impressed} Sounds like you've done some blue collar construction work in your life, your Ma must be proud. Still...
[FAILED] "Butt" is right. That heart-shaped charge in the stuffing will cause just the right amount of bleeding.
{Frowns} Great, a moron - just what I need. {Beat} Look? That seat you're sitting in? It's a {emph} bomb. Go boom.
Get up without my permission, I'll blast your ass so far through your head, it'll turn the moon cherry pie red.
So - let's keep this sweet and polite, and finish our conversation with no misunderstandings.
Just because I work in entertainment, doesn't mean I'm a moron.
I heard my necktie beeping, I know what that means - I'm part of this somehow. I want out of this contract.
{Colder} And if you put me in it, I'm not going to be too happy. So whatever's going on here, if you're part of all this? You're taking orders from me.
{Talking level with the player, relieved to be saved} I'm not an idiot. I know the reason I'm in here now is because of the old guy - and you.
{Rueful} And {emph} you're wearing a collar, so I trust you a {emph} little more than the old guy. {Beat, throw this line away} He's more controlling than I'd like.
{Whispering} Thing is, here's where being my {emph} partner pays off. See, I know how to get into the casino vault.
So here's the short of it - piece together Little Miss Vera Keyes' song in the right order? {Beat, spreads hands} Sierra Madre opens its legs, we're in business.
[SUCCEEDED] {Pleased} And that's what I've missed - a rapt audience.
[FAILED] You don't listen too good, do you? {Colder} Makes me think whatever you have to say isn't worth my time.
{Irritated, bad side starts coming out} Oh, of course you do. Now, it's like we're married with these big wedding rings around our necks.
So why don't you hear {emph} my proposal first, before you start talking about what {emph} you need.
Christ, if that collar blows, I don't know if you'd know the difference, you'd probably still keep walking around with that dumb, blank look.
{Different than other one - speaking to an idiot, so emphasis is different} Just because I work in entertainment, doesn't mean {emph} I'm a moron.
{Slightly friendlier, let's-make-a-deal} Good, good - then we're in business. I may be a betting man, but I like it when the odds are in our favor.
If you're here with who I think, then I'd rather have you on my side than his. An... ace in the hole.
You want to live, I want what's in the Madre. Real simple.
All right, all right... look, I'll hand it over, I promise. No need to get all upset. We can both come out ahead in this.
{Flustered} What? Hey, hey... now... w-wait... I... {angered} ah, forget it. Time for the hard way. {<THEATER: Dean curses Player, getting ready to fight to the death>}
{Frowns} What are you talking about? Medical report? Vera wasn't...
{Thinking} ...the Med-X and Superstims. And here I thought she was trying to numb herself to the lights.
Sinclair must have known, though. He was dense, not in that way. But... that doesn't make any sense. If she was sick, dying...
...then why build this place? Why start a damn casino and have her be the lock?
Because she could get closer to Sinclair than I ever could. He built this place for her... well, after the two "chanced" to meet.
That's... hmm. Never mind, doesn't change anything. The Sierra Madre's still waiting for us to crack it open.
I waited an entire lifetime! Sitting in that Villa, watching it all fall apart - Sinclair's Sierra Madre towering over everything? Untouched?!
Then you show up, thinking you can just take it all from me, you and the old man running the show? I {emph} planned all this, I {emph} made it all happen, not you!
Sure, yeah, I have the key on me. I made other keys, too, to unlock the casino and ruin Sinclair, finally. After all these years...
No... now... now I think ruining you and all your plans would be enough for me. Kill me, I still win, you're never getting in the vault.
Tourists, you bet. They don't stay long... and they don't stay alive long.
If they survive the Cloud, the Ghost People, the traps, then greed takes over, and they start sizing each other up for funeral suits.
{Choosing his words carefully, the locals are, well, zombies} "Alive's" a tricky word. The locals, the Ghost People? Not sure it applies to them.
They're a little... uncivilized. They don't talk much. As in, at all.
{Skeptical} Well... "safely?" Around here, that word doesn't come cheap.
Safely? What, after your sweet-and-ruthless talk when we first met, now you care about my safety? Right.
Really? You don't strike me as the type, especially after our little "how can I cooperate" chat at my home.
Real funny. {Beat} Although you know, after your "collar talk" in the Residential area, I believe you.
Look... I strike up the speaker system, there's going to be ghosts all over this place. Any change in the sounds around here...
...the Ghost People are not big on talking, they are big on listening. Hunting. Killing. More vicious than music critics, trust me.
{Like told to wait in a DMZ} In the middle of town here? Alone? On a {emph} rooftop, with a big lightshow in the air? {<Dean doesn't want to stay in a DMZ with zombies all around.>}
{Sarcastic} Tell you what - why don't you just give me one of those Space Age Cosmic Knives so I can slit my wrists, be less {emph} painful checking out that way.
That so?
Tried talking to them, bribing them, leaving food - nothing. In the years since, they haven't changed their approach, but I sure have.
They catch you, they drag you into the Cloud, and you're not coming back out. {To himself}After that, having your necktie go off would be mercy.
My advice? Stay out of their way, they don't die easy.
That's an interesting clause. {Frowns} That's a real bad contract you have. We have.
[SUCCEEDED] {Frowns, suspicious} What are you talking about?
[FAILED] The hand's been dealt, {emph} that's the deal. You going along with my terms, or do you want your brains to be wallpaper?
Just like all the rest. Strolling in here, thinking you own the place. I've been here longer than {emph} any of you tourists.
Trust me, I'm letting you off easier than the Sierra Madre ever would. Nobody's going to miss you... whoever you are, you're old news.
{Laughs} All right, all right... looks like marriage finally caught me.
I'm listening... partner. What's next, if we're death-til-we-part?
Not one for fighting if we can avoid it. Still, wasn't bad at the pistol range and over the years, I've learned how to handle a knife...
{Little quieter} ...and explosives a bit. A bit. {To himself} Made a lot of mistakes along the way. Still have my fingers, though.
Not leaving me much choice. The Fountain, huh? {Beat} Hope the Hologram's still working and the battery's running strong.
I'll follow you, I'm not going alone, trust me. Not like I'm a coward or anything, I'm not running around town without an escort.
I'm serious. One of the locals catches us, we aren't coming back - and I'd like to keep an eye on you.
You shoot them, they get back up. You stab them, they get back up.
That's why I have explosives all over this place - unless you blow them up, chop them up, disintegrate 'em, {shakes head} the Ghost People don't go down.
Not enough bullets in the town to spend on them. So unless you're a real good shot, save one for yourself right before they catch you.
[SUCCEEDED] {Studying player} Well... you seem like you know how to handle yourself. All right.
Once, I fired a lucky shot, hit a gas tank one was holding. Blew his arm off at the shoulder... and he didn't get back up after that.
So if you're {emph} that good, don't aim for the head - aim for their bombs. And if you can wait until his buddies are close by, even better.
[FAILED] Yeah, well, "probably" is something a gambler says, not a survivor. I'd keep your pistol where it belongs - in the holster.
{Slight exasperation, as if he's thought about this a lot, then tries to recall Hamlet quote}Friend... "there's more mysteries in heaven and earth..." wait, no, "there is more between heaven and earth..." oh, forget it.
I'd sooner ask what makes me an undying son of a bitch than spend any thought as to why {emph} they crawled to life here.
I'm counting myself lucky I still have my faculties - they sure don't. Then again, they may not have had the... focus I do.
Wait, wait... wait just a minute. I'm not walking out there on my own.
Always had the Sierra Madre to keep my mind occupied.
Most folks, they don't have the same drive, the same need. Not worth my time. Pretty much Ghost People before the Bomb, now Ghost People after.
I know what's out there. It's why I've planted a mine field, shotguns, and explosives all the way on the road to my little boudoir here.
So we go together, or we're not going at all. I'll split my hand in Blackjack when the time's right, I'm not splitting up in this town, trust me.
All right... partner.
All right, all right... but you already got company, so tell you what - I'll meet you at the Fountain.
That's... a good point. All right, let me grab some smokes, and I'll meet you at the Fountain.
All right, keep it short, we don't have a lot of time.
{Slight irritation} Of course you do. Let's hear 'em.
It's your time, and if you want to spend it chatting, not much I can do about it.
{Dean gets deadly serious here, his fear should foreshadow end of Act 2} Whatever we do - don't rile them up. Normally, there's only a few, maybe a pack. There's more out there, a lot more.
If they find out someone's trespassing, it'd be shaking a hornet's nest. Don't want to think how many of them could fill these streets.
Those little company stores? Sinclair's toy boxes, put in a casino chip, get a treat, {angry at self} like you're some dog doing tricks.
Take any of the casino chips, put 'em into the machine, and you'll get something out - a snack, a cola, something to mend a tear in your shirt.
Sometimes you have to know exactly what to ask for, other times, there's codes for... eh, unconventional items. For emergencies.
{Took vending machines for granted, realizes player may not} Yeah, well, machines like those weren't unusual before the Bomb. Maybe to you, they're amazing, to me, they're grifters without the personality.
Sinclair made sure if you spent money here, it went {emph} one direction - although that's not how {emph} he described it.
Called it "self-sufficient." Like he was doing the residents a favor. Right.
If it's an emergency, you can get chems for any... uh... condition. Sinclair left that for doctors and trained professionals, not the common folk.
Even security and maintenance could get special supplies out of them. Staff had codes on little cards they could use to unlock them.
Around. Don't have much use for them myself, not worth the risk to get them.
I got all the basics covered, as long as I have the chips to pay for them. I don't need much.
The Cloud? Showed up after the Bomb. {Frowns} I think. I got used to it in small doses. Now, it covers the city.
{Slightly sad for a moment} Over the years, it kept climbing up out of the Sierra Madre, until it was curtains for the sun. Didn't see the sky again.
Doesn't seem to bother the Ghost People. Can't see through it too well, though, so sometimes I can use the Cloud for cover... if I get desperate.
Residential area, clinic, police station - should keep away from the police station, it's a Ghost People hangout.
Salida del Sol, Puesta del Sol are East Town, West Town. "Sunrise" and "Sunset." {To himself, irritated} Or were when the streets and sky weren't covered with toxic gas.
Ghost People don't come into the Villa much. West Town and East Town, though... they're thick with the Cloud {emph} and Ghost People. Like hunting grounds.
{Slightly defensive, angry, echoing player's "stupid" accusation} Stupid? No, playing it smart. {Emph} You're the dumb one, waltzing in here without realizing who the headliner is. {<Dean bids farewell to the Player. The trap springs, and he retreats to the stage's scaffolding/hallways to avoid harm - Holograms are on>}
I can take a chump like you even if I didn't have eight lives lined up behind me, and a rising soundtrack. So put your dancing shoes on - let's go. {<THEATER: Dean curses Player, getting ready to fight to the death>}
{Slight nervous} No idea... woke up here, thought I was dreaming for a second... right back on stage, the mic... {Thinking about to the show days...}
Thought I was back at the Fronds... {to himself}well, except no audience, used to pack theaters back then... so stepped up on the stage, check things out...
Then suddenly Holograms walked out of the wings... and they started raising their hands to their heads all creepy-like, {emph} not a good sign.
No... looks like a {emph} rooftop in Puesta del Sol. In better days, nice view. Now? It's the last place anyone wants to stand when this event goes off. {Correcting player, then takes a breath - this isn't good news.}
That place during Spring, Summer, and Fall, a little bit in Winter, is a prime resort spot for Ghost People. Not the best of neighborhoods.
If we're going there, I'm not going alone. And if you have any bright ideas about telling me to stroll over there - or leave me there? No thanks.
No... no, no... I'm not leaving this spot. Why dirty my hands when the Sierra Madre can kill you for me?
{Smug, a little eager} Time for a little show - I'll just grab a seat and watch how this plays out from backstage. Security can handle it from here. {<Dean bids farewell to the Player. The trap springs, and he retreats to the stage's scaffolding/hallways to avoid harm - Holograms are on>}
Look, I'm more about the short goodbyes than long thankful speeches... {sincere} but I appreciate you bailing me out of a tight spot there - partner.
I know you didn't do it out of the goodness of your heart. So let me give you something a little more practical - a way we both come out ahead.
I know you didn't do it out of the goodness of your heart. So... instead of empty words and a flourish, let me give you something more useful.
{Smug, confident} No, I'm not. {emph} I'll get out in time - you won't. {Already planning ahead, as if free and clear already} Once I kill you, exit stage left, and my collar will go quiet.
{Incredulous} You think {emph} I'm the bad guy here? I'm not the one slapping bomb collars on innocent folks and flicking the switch. {<Dean bids farewell to the Player. The trap springs, and he retreats to the stage's scaffolding/hallways to avoid harm - Holograms are on>}
{Sing-song, then disdainful in second half} And I'm not stabbing you in the back. I was facing you all the time. This heist? I planned it lifetimes ago. You and that old man? Tourists.
Partner, I'm not sure this guy's operating with a full deck. My bet? Process of elimination, lowest common denominator.
He figures the "Strong Man"'s needed somewhere, {to himself} even if it sounds like the Strong Man's {emph} two minds about it. {Two minds b/c Dog (Strong Man) has multiple personalities.}
Plus, I'm guessing wherever ol' Doggy Boy's needed doesn't need smarts. {Beat, to himself} I hope not, or we're royally jones'd.
{Confiding, superior} There's a private elevator, Sinclair's elevator. It's up in the Executive Suites, in Vera's room. {Beat, emph} Not a coincidence.
Vera. {Reluctant, quiet} She was... my other partner, before the Bomb. {Quieter} Took some legwork. Some convincing, made it happen.
Elevator's up in the Executive Suites. Voice-activated. Speak the right phrase, in the right tone of voice, and it's open sesame.
I was able to snag the voice, {beat downnote} or thought I had. {Normal tone} The right tone and phrasing... well, that may take some time.
Yeah, the woman, the Starlet, Vera - her voice. {Grumbles to himself} Didn't realize there was so many holotapes of her still around, otherwise... eh, never mind.
{Thinking} No, that I still had to figure out - still do. Sinclair wrote stuff down, was obsessive about it. Just got to find where.
Go knock yourself out. I'm just going to catch my breath a bit. That performance... well, more pressure than I was expecting.
Didn't see anyone come in? Well... they'll be here soon.
And go on, run for the exit door, this'll be fun to watch.
Sinclair was already puppy-eyed, so all I had to do was the introductions. {Disgusted} She smiled, fluttered her eyes, showed a little leg...
{A little colder, disgust chilling} ...and he built this whole place for her. Made {emph} her the key to his vault, like a joke, cause of her name. {Draw this out} Her fake Hollywood name. {Bitter.}
{Malicious, implying "been" = sex} Except Sinclair didn't know I'd been there first. I could twist her whatever direction I wanted.
All she had to do was get inside the Sierra Madre for the Gala, then use her voice to open the door. {Smiles} After that... smooth sailing.
{Gleeful, slight malicious} Would have been the biggest heist in history. Sinclair left holding the bag. Ruined.
{Quiet, reflective} The Bomb. Vera got sealed in here. {Throwaway} A few hundred years go by, give-or-take. {Emph} Almost the end of the story - then you came along.
{Rallying} Now we finish the job. Rob the Sierra Madre, rip out its heart. Last chapter of Frederick Sinclair, close the book.
{Slight surprise, hasn't given a lot of thought to this in a long time} Problem? All high-and-mighty. Lording it over everyone. Acting so self-righteous, like nothing could touch him. He was the one with the problem.
{Colder, losing himself} Never got mad at anything. Nothing seemed to shake him. Even after... his life kept getting dragged through the dirt.
{Cold, staring into the distance} Always kept looking for the bright, shining future in everything. So... I decided to take everything from him.
Do to me? {Frowns} What, weren't you listening? He thought he was {emph} better than me. Don't believe me? Look around.
This big casino, this big colossal monument - think it was for some woman? No, all ego, all self-righteous-in-lights, fit him perfect.
Had to take him down a few pegs, bring him down to my level. "Begin again?" Some things you don't get up from... I was going to prove it.
{Mocking, he's echoing one of his songs} I only saw her yesterday. Well, a few yesterdays.
I didn't know at first. Then the old man showed up. You showed up. Then... that woman showed up, covered in scars.
The one who makes all the hand signs, a little tight around the corners of her mouth.
I put her in the Clinic, tuned her like an instrument. If she heals up, it's not going to be her voice speaking any more.
That is, if the Sierra Madre didn't get her. If it did... well, there's enough of Vera around for me to spend a few years piecing a book together.
Then she can make some beautiful music. I'm not banking on it.
Why? Survival. I still needed to leave the Residential Area to scrounge up supplies, and I don't like taking chances.
The Villa's dangerous. So I left weapons and stims in case I got in a tight spot. {Grumbling}Then, of course, {emph} you show up, putting your mitts on everything.
I suppose this qualifies as an emergency, so I'm not complaining. Much.
{Defensive} I still need to eat. At least I think I do. The Villa provides... even if it's not as glamorous as the Cantina Madrid.
Once I... well, realized what you could scrounge up around here, I had a lot of time to experiment. Not the best chef, but...
...well, here's the mix, if you can stomach it. {Rueful} I call it a "Sierra Madre Martini."
{Reluctant} No... you're not the type, but accidents happen, good intentions or no.
Really? That wasn't the "we're both bomb-married" talk you gave me when we first met.
Look, you could offer me a steel clad contract for a world tour of all major cities with Imperial Records, I still wouldn't stay here.
{Sounds like dupe of another line, isn't, this one's friendlier, more confused} I was already was halfway off the rooftop, through the service tunnel and making a break for the gate before the light show started...
...and before Vera finished her Gala speech... I knew what'd happen with "music" in the streets and lights in the sky... Ghost People. Lots of them.
Also meant the front gate was open, and no way was I missing it after all these years. Then... I walk in... and...
Scrape some Cloud Residue off the walls, mash it in a Tin Can with some Junk Food from the machines, then hold your nose and down it.
There's Electric Hot Plates around if you can't find a campfire to mix it at. Also, there's other recipes you can do with the Cloud Residue...
...although it might take a hardier survivalist than me to brew them. I stick to martinis.
{Disdainful} Sure, nice words, nice promises... not worth a dime out here in the shadow of the Sierra Madre. {Not buying the offer.}
You say you wouldn't leave me here, I know better. {Low threat} And you leave me here, this Gala Event isn't going to happen, I can feel it.
Christine, that her name? Nice name. I mean, you can't see it on posters, but... never mind.
I don't know. She might need to hold some place where speaking isn't important. Like stage tech? Lighting? Got me.
And me? I've had prime billing in Europe, New York... and this gig doesn't feel like that.
Don't get me wrong, I can hold an audience, conduct a score from the rooftops, but I'm guessing I'm the odd man out in this whole heist.
Little Miss Silence...? Maybe she needs to be in some place where she can be seen, but being heard isn't important?
[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... maybe the drain in power, that'll cause the security systems to shut down enough to let us in. But... getting back out?
No, the place'll close up tighter than an opening at the Fronds. {To himself} Or Danny Parker's sphincter when he has to tip a doorman. {Fronds = Old World casino, Danny Parker = Old World entertainer that Domino didn't like too much.}
[FAILED] Interesting... in the sense that having some light show open the Sierra Madre? Interesting to me, who would have thought? {Whoops, almost revealed too much, backpedaling a bit here before the player finds him out.}
Oh, it'll light up the casino, light up the sky... set the speakers in the Villa to play beautiful, soothing music. {Oh, sure, it'll be all sweetness and roses...}
...and when I say soothing music, I mean with the speakers being the state they are, things'll be screaming, all right. Think air raid sirens. {...if by roses, you mean Venus flytraps.}
That means it'll wake up everything in town like a hornet's nest. Not sure what a hornet is? Forget it - basically, trouble.
Vera was a big star, back before the Bomb. Not the best actress, but... well, she had other talents. Nice voice, nice legs.
For some reason, Sinclair... he built this place... she caught his eye. {Shrugs} Once he was hooked, that was it, had to have her.
So made the introductions, and guess what? He builds this place for her, like some kind of Cleopatra obsession. {Beat, looks around}Wasn't always a deathtrap.
Of course. What, some kind of surprise to you that I knew people once? Used to have my name in lights, all right?
Knew a dozen Veras, or whatever her name was. Uh... "Vera Keyes." Figured I could pay Sinclair back, introduce the two...
{To himself} ...guy was a slouch in the dame department, had to pick up the slack somehow.
{Slight surprise} The Clinic? {Beat, a little wary}Yeah, I did bring her in. Before the Gala... well, before the first Gala Event. A few lifetimes ago. {Dean's initially worried he's been "caught" at the opening of this thread, then recovers, tries to dismiss it.}
She was a stress case, throat was shot, all nerves. When she wasn't doped up on Med-X or Superstimming her pain away...
...look, never mind. I don't want to speak bad about her. She was a classy woman, good singer, and if she couldn't act her way out of a box...
...she was Sinclair's world, and that's all that mattered. He didn't need to know any of that, any of her history.
Sure. First, they figure they can get out, escape. {Beat, slow, emph} Then they start thinking it over, start thinking about how they can have it all.
They start weighing the odds, taking risks... and then taking each other out. Bomb collars or not.
Although... it's odd, the bomb collars weren't linked before like they are now. Guess someone learned what the problem was.
Dead. Either got killed by one of the Villa's attractions, locals, or the beautiful weather.
Can tell you right now - they didn't stick close to each other, and when they did, they let down their guard at the wrong moment.
Some left signposts to others, trying to help them out - just led to them getting killed by someone a little more greedy than they were.
Well... considering my life's on the line, too, yeah, a few things.
First off, keep everyone together. Keep checking behind you, make sure your partners are following... {emph} don't let them wander.
Also, don't go running crazy everywhere. Almost every inch of this town is lethal. So if you're not sure, take it real slow.
And speaking of slow, don't go shouting, or attracting attention. Go quiet. The Ghost People find you, it's over.
{Frowns, remembers player doesn't know this}Right, look - so, not everything about the Villa was the pinnacle of bright ideas.
In order to pull off the Gala, old Sinclair had to get creative... the Sierra Madre announcement, for example. Not just for the casino, not at all.
The Gala's tied to the casino, draws on its power. Might cause it to reset itself, open the doors for a bit like it was supposed to.
Well, Vera's beautiful voice doesn't run on casino power, exactly. Her broadcast is tied into the emergency broadcast signal for the Sierra Madre.
You know, in case of attack? Well, guess what - the night of the Gala Event, the emergency signal went out all right.
But because the broadcast had been hooked up to the Gala Event, instead of an emergency signal, you get Vera's voice on the radio. Great, huh?
Yeah. The Sierra Madre's last song, one only a few people are ever going to hear. A little sad, but what can you do?
Odd Man out... dead weight. Someone you need holding the toolbox, the nurse passing the scalpel, the chauffer driving you to the concert.
Any guy with {emph} hands is who he needs up on that rooftop. Guess he thinks I don't rate, looking like I do. {Beat} Poor him.
{Uneasy} Look... those ghosts are going to come out of the wings behind you in a second, the security types, {emph} not the "friendly" bald types.
And if you got in here, the door's probably locked tight behind you - so {emph} don't back up or run for the exit, you're not going to make it.
Trust me - as soon as you can, run to the door to the {emph} left - use the key you got out of the music rag there, and camp out.
As bad as things are, it's going to get a lot worse if either of us pops - so get backstage... {under his breath} until we get a better plan.
{DUPE} Good, go, and don't get yourself killed - do that, and we're both done.
Good, go, and don't get yourself killed - do that, and we're both done.
{Nervous} Look... just get rid of them, all right? Tried to slip off stage, then they all started changing color and raising their hands... {emph}not a good sign. {<Dean pleads to be rescued from the Theater's Holograms. He vanishes into the stage's scaffolding/hallways to hide away from them - Holograms are on>}
[SUCCEEDED] Uh... right. Uh... let's see... when you get the door open, there'll be an exit door dead ahead. {Emph} Don't take it.
It's most likely filled with toxins from the vents. So hug the wall, make as much space between you and the door... or it's Cloud Nine in a casket. {Or it's curtains for you.}
Past that... {thinking} is my dressing room. Under the table there's a footlocker. It's tucked back a bit, so you might miss it. Inside, a gun, some ammo.
Not much help against the ghosts, still, if you're about to give up, call it quits? {Beat, punchline}Throw it to {emph} me so I can eat a bullet first.
[FAILED] Anything else? I've told you all I can think of! Now, come on, get going.
{Slight nervous} You are preaching to the choir. Sinclair and his security... don't even get me started. Those Holograms... {Being slightly casual in his speech here, even though his life is in danger.}
[SUCCEEDED] {Slight frustration - what's the player getting at?} Yeah... yeah, so what? We got bigger problems with the Holograms... no, no, wait, you're right. {Reverses his tone, realizes the player's thinking long term, which is smart.}
{Frustrated} The Theater piped music and sound backstage, which means those little squealers are in the corridors back there, too.
[FAILED] {Urgent} What about them? The speakers won't kill you if you leave them alone, don't worry about them, just get backstage. {Increased urgency at the end, but won't raise his voice.}
Uh... let's see. Um, once you break right, watch each turn in the corridor, one'll be on your right past my dressing room - and up.
Oh, my dressing room - may have left the radio on, right by the table... uh, if you could just shut it off instead of blowing it u... uh, never mind.
{Remembering} And there was a speaker in the prop room, too - on the wall between the entrances. And... well, walk slow - there's bound to be more.
[SUCCEEDED] {Thinking} Yeah... yeah, right. So... let's see... security's here because the show hasn't started. Guests aren't allowed in, so...
...guess we need to start the show. Okay... so when they were setting this place up... we had rehearsals...
{relaxes a bit} ...and heh... Sinclair even set up hologram recordings of the shows so we could watch and critique our performances before a fake audience. {Beat, slight anger} Whatever. {Slight anger at end, reminding himself he hates Sinclair.}
Thing is, when the recording queued up, a nice, calm, appreciative audience appeared in the Theater - no security with their head-blasting zap rays.
So, find the music, get it to the projector room upstairs, then play it...? Might reset security, worth a shot.
[FAILED] One thing at a time - and buying time is what we need, all right? Think in the now, it'll sort itself out. {Beat} I hope.
Look, I'm in danger here, all right, not exactly thinking with a level head, so cut me some slack. {Beat} Please. {Genuinely sorry at the end, realizes player could leave him out to dry.}
The speakers are all controlled by a central console. {Thinking} It's the farthest from the only door out of here...
...so you'd need to do a full circuit of the corridor to get to it. Once there, you'll need to shut it down, and I don't have the code.
If you have the code, you can turn off {emph} all the speakers, make them settle down. Getting backstage should buy us time, just take it slow.
The Holotape should be where I left it... no, wait. It's... it's in Vera's dressing room, probably. May... may be a key to her room on my desk.
Anyway... snag the key out of my room, and look around Vera's room, the Holotape has to be there. As for getting it to the projection booth...
Well... sometimes Vera used to watch from the projection booth, so she must have had a master key... look around her room, might be there.
[SUCCEEDED] What? Oh, my left - your right. So, yeah, run to the door on your right. {Beat}Heh, almost got you killed there. {To himself} Us killed there.
[FAILED] Right, the locked door to the left. Watch out, the guards are going to materialize in any second, crouch and take it slow.
Do I have to spell it out? Come on. Time's wasting, and those Holograms are going to be on us any second.
What? Are you sure? {Beat, realizes} That song... that stupid song of hers... no, that makes perfect sense.
And it was always playing here in the casino... dammit, if I'd only brought a recording inside... so, what, you're trying to recover it?
Oh, I'm not going to fight you - I'm going to let {emph} security show you out. Didn't see anyone come in? Well... they'll be here soon.
Guess Vera echoes down through the ages, then. Sierra Madre hasn't completely forgotten her.
{Frowns} So that's why you showed... you wanted what was in the music archives on this floor, hook up the signal. Nice.
[SUCCEEDED] No... no... the collars... I know what happened now. Sure, mine activated... but it feels different, the electronic tapdance inside.
I can kill you and still make it out while security is busy frying you to a crisp. Hands are clean, then smooth sailing to the Sierra Madre.
[FAILED] No... I know how the collars behave now, in here anyway. At least the Sierra Madre gave me {emph} that.
I should be thankful, in a second, it'll give me another gift - with any luck, security'll leave enough of your ashes for an urn on my mantle.
Well, yeah in the Villa. {More to himself} But I have one inside, too.
We can talk about that later, though, it's not important right now... you came for me, any sign of the others? {A little cagier here, is trying to figure out if Christine is alive.}
Figures... wish he'd show himself, although I'm betting he's not doing that until we've cracked the vault.
{Thinking} That means we'll still need a copy of the song to get into the vault... and after all I went through to smuggle a copy inside.
Wait... you said this guy wanted you to deal with all of us first? What, is everyone else here? {Realizes what the player just said.}
It's safe. I hope. Right now, let's focus on getting everyone {emph} else to safety, all right? Everybody else all right?
Forget that walking stomach, not interested in being his lunch... just glad the girl's all right. Where is she? Is she here?
Wait... no, if the Sierra Madre assigned people to floors, she's got to have been sent to Vera's room, right? That's irony for you.
Perfect, couldn't have worked out better.
{Frustrated} Dead? For the love of... this whole heist was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
{DUPE: Frustrated} Dead? For the love of... Chopping up her voice box was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
Figured that out, huh? Clever.
Figures... wish he'd show himself, although I'm betting he's not doing that until we've cracked the vault.
{Thinking} That means we'll still need a copy of the song to get into the vault... and after all I went through to smuggle a copy inside.
Wait... you said this guy wanted you to deal with all of us first? What, is everyone else here? {Realizes what the player just said.}
You know... people can still surprise me. All right, I believe you. You got spine. {Raises an eyebrow} Guess the bombs left a little human goodwill behind.
At least you're honest, can't blame you. I'd have done the same if there was a trigger to my head... or a collar on my neck.
{Brushoff, needs player to leave} I'll be fine, don't worry about me. Go on ahead, I'm going to try and unwind.
All right - well, thanks for bailing me out.
So - what, you're heading to the main terminal now that you've got this floor unlocked?
{Frowns} Hnh. You got a point. {Frowns, warning} You better not let me down. Try and get into the Sierra Madre without me? You'll wish you hadn't. {< Weighing the player's offer, makes sense. >}
{Slight hesitation} All right... look, if the Holograms are here to keep me company, then... I don't mind staying here for a while.
But listen... {Frowns, warning} when this thing goes off, try and get into the Sierra Madre without me? You'll wish you hadn't. {< Weighing the player's offer, makes sense. >}
It's safe. I hope. Right now, let's focus on getting everyone {emph} else to safety, all right? Everybody else all right?
And here I thought I was being clever. {To himself} Teach me to hold my cards a little closer to the chest... whole heist was a gamble anyway.
Still... there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives, right? Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal?
[SUCCEEDED] Dead? After all I went through... after all that hauling her body through the streets?
[FAILED] Really... "partner." Now, now... you can't pull one over on Dean... but you tried, didn't you?
So you don't want to share... keep her from me, huh? All we have to do is make her sing, and it's all ours.
Although... why lie to me? I'm hurt. I mean, we don't even {emph} need her if you get the terminals live, and the music kicking.
Forget that walking stomach, not interested in being his lunch... just glad the girl's all right. Where is she? Is she here?
Wait... no, if the Sierra Madre assigned people to floors, she's got to have been sent to Vera's room, right? That's irony for you.
Perfect, couldn't have worked out better. So - what, you're heading to the main terminal now that you've got this floor unlocked?
{Frustrated} Dead? For the love of... chopping up her voice box was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
Still... there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives, right? Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal?
All right... even if they all end up dead, though, you say there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives.
Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal to tie it all together? Easy. Just a little legwork.
Yeah? Little bit of two-reel memories... we're here to steal from the Sierra Madre, not from each other. {Player found a blackmail tape Dean used for heist.}
Blackmail is such a strong word. I asked her, she said yes, then... she started to get cold feet.
I blame Sinclair... he was such a victim, that maybe she felt it would be too easy... it doesn't matter.
Sinclair built this whole town to accommodate her. Same with the casino's voice lock. He wanted to make sure she had access to everything.
And since I already had access to Vera... well, that meant I had access to the vault, too.
What {emph} wasn't I blackmailing her with. {Flippant} Chem use, indiscretions, more chem use... the usual Hollywood tune.
Like Sinclair, people are the architects of their own misfortunes. Leave themselves wide open for someone to waltz right in and take what they want.
As long as they take a single step into the trap. Get a few pictures, get a little dirt, and that person's your piano.
Vera? Med-X was her thing, even Superstimmed herself for the after-rush. Sick. {Superstimmed is a chem, supposed to heal chronic damage and suppress pain. Causes a damaging numbing affer-effect.}
{Smug, dismissive} Way I figure it, you'll try and run for the exit, and only I know where the key is - and where the safest place in the whole theater is: backstage.
You, you're trapped down there, and you couldn't shut off the speakers, unlock the doors, or cancel security if you tried.
{Smug} I'm not a betting man, I've come too far to leave it to chance.
{Uneasy} What... what now? Try and come back {emph} here?
{Uneasy} No, you belong out in the audience... I mean, not like... uh... you could get backstage. That key you snagged, it won't work.
{Frustrated} Of all the... where the hell are those stupid Holograms already? {Beat} Even if you get back here, you won't live long, trust me.
No, you want to know why? Because there's more beneath the streets, in the buildings, and oh - everywhere else.
They hear anything out of the ordinary, especially "music" screaming through the speakers when I close the connection? They'll be here, fast.
Take? It's not going to take anything because you couldn't {emph} offer me anything to stay here.
The Ghost People'll come out of the woodwork when the Gala Event starts blaring, and when they see me trapped up here? It's curtains for Dean.
[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. If the Hologram systems still work, that'd do the trick.
Okay... all right, you call up some of those Old World stiffs, that'd be an audience I wouldn't mind having below.
[FAILED] Yeah, and how can you guarantee that? I'm not waiting here alone, trust me.
I mean, if I had a few of those Holograms... or a few hundred... surrounding me, maybe. I'd settle for two, enough to cover a quick exit.
You're full of it - you kill me, we both die. You wouldn't dare.
So you leaving me here? No dice, not going to happen, and nothing you can say will change my mind.
{Frowns} You can look all you want... I still feel safer with a pair of Hologram escorts to make it through the area.
{Thinking} You powered the Holograms up? {Beat} Well... yeah, that's pretty good protection. {To himself} Sure worked at the fountain, Vera kept the Ghost People away.
{Uneasy} But, uh... how do I know the power won't suddenly go out? And... I don't know, this still sounds risky to me. {Emph} For me.
If I remember correctly, there should be two Holograms you can switch on in the area... just don't remember how.
Do that, and I'll consider waiting on the rooftop. Maybe.
{Slight surprise, confused} What? What are you talking about?
{Sounds like dupe of another line, isn't, this one's angrier, smug} Me? I was halfway off the rooftop, through the service tunnel and bee-lining for the gate before the light show started...
...and before Vera finished her Gala speech... I knew what'd happen with "music" in the streets and lights in the sky... Ghost People. Lots of them.
But that was your problem. {Beat} Anyway, front gate was open, no way I was letting {emph} you get in first. {Slight confusion} I walk in... there's a flash... and I'm here.
Must have been Sinclair's security... he always had a thing about letting any threats into the casino. Security system's twitchy that way.
{Smug} Me, though, I'm a guest here, so I guess I got the royal treatment after all.
{Wary} You wouldn't. You need me to strike up the sparking chords there. Breaking my legs isn't any way to get {emph} me to dance.
You wouldn't... {frowns} no, yeah, you would. I would. If I thought you screaming wouldn't attract more of the locals.
All right, I'll stay here. For now. But you leave me high and dry, make a run for the Sierra Madre? You'll pay for it, I promise you. {Suspicious, warning.}
What? You wouldn't. I mean... no, wait, you would. You don't bluff, ever since you first showed up in the Villa and we chatted.
No... you wouldn't. You're not the type. Even when you first showed up in the Villa, you didn't threaten me.
You just let me talk, not even letting on that our collars were linked, when all you had to do was tell me that to get me to come along.
So... no, I don't think you'll shut them off. You don't threaten people, not your way.
Wait, hold on. I didn't say I was scared. {Snorts}Heh, heh. Cold feet? Don't be ridiculous. I've played to worse crowds than this, I can hold the fort here.
[SUCCEEDED] {DUPE: Reluctant, convincing}Well... yeah. You got a point.
[FAILED] What do I want? I want a little more insurance than some Old World Villa construction to guard me, all right?
[SUCCEEDED] {DUPE: Reluctant, convincing}Well... yeah. You got a point.
[FAILED] Trust you? Right. You're not the one who has to sit up here and wait for the Ghost People to show.
[SUCCEEDED] {Reluctant, convincing} Well... yeah. You got a point.
[FAILED] {Skeptical} Really? You're not the one standing up here waiting for the Ghost People to show, all right?
Oh, right, after all the "we'll both blow up if you don't do as I say" talk we first had. Not put me in danger? Right.
Yeah... yeah, you're right. You didn't have to switch on those Holograms, and you did.
Even when you first showed up in the Villa, you didn't threaten me, were just willing to cooperate to get through this. Hnh.
Unless he's got a friend, no dice. Nobody relies on a single escape route unless they want to get caught.
{DUPE} Unless he's got a friend, no dice. Nobody relies on a single escape route unless they want to get caught.
Don't have to take the long way back - there's a shortcut across the way, you see. {Dean has just joined the party, they're striking up a conversation.}
It's through the Cloud - but if I'm with you, I can help you through it. {To himself, the player better not have} If you didn't already force the lock to the gate, that is.
Have a seat - came all this way, least I can do is let you rest your feet for a second.
Just sit there on my little casting couch - more a chair, really, but I prefer up-and-comers to relax when I interview them.
You're my guest. If you're going to be rude, you can show yourself out. {little quieter} Probably won't tap-dance no more when you leave, but that's on you.
You standing there is making me nervous. Sit down, will you?
Have a seat.
{Dean walking in on Vera as she's getting ready}Pretty as a picture. {<AUDIO: Holotape Filter for whole topic. No ghoul filter for Dean.>A recording of Dean walking into Vera's dressing room, predatory, blackmail.}
I'm not wearing my dancing shoes, so I walk a little softly now. {Mock menacing} What, you think I was a Chinaman, come to cut your American throat? {Holotape recording, tense, Dean's here to insure Vera's cooperation in the heist.}
{Slightly predatory} What... no hug? Come here. {Holotape recording, tense, Dean's here to insure Vera's cooperation in the heist.}
You sing like a bird, pop the safe, and we're as through as through can be. {Holotape recording, tense, Dean's here to insure Vera's cooperation in the heist.}
{Vera's starting to get cold feet, Dean doesn't like this} You don't know? I ask one simple favor of you, and you tell me "no?" {Holotape recording, tense, Dean's here to insure Vera's cooperation in the heist.}
You're right, you don't think. {Cold, angry. Holotape recording, getting tenser. Dean's about to tell Vera she's going to do the job, no matter what.}
I don't need you - I'll send you back to the farm, worse off than you were, because you'll have seen the Sierra Madre, and had to let it {emph}all go. {Holotape recording, getting tenser. Dean's about to tell Vera she's going to do the job, no matter what.}
I could have gotten any leggy dame out of Hollywood to get out here and play Sinclair's heart strings. {Holotape recording, getting tenser. Dean's about to tell Vera she's going to do the job, no matter what. "Holowood" intentional.}
You just happened to be the one I caught, and it was really your own fault, a little too much into the chems and meds, and... {Holotape recording, getting tenser. Dean's about to tell Vera she's going to do the job, no matter what.}
{Placating, but still leaving the hooks in} Aw, shhh, don't cry. Look, I'm not trying to hurt {emph} you. Just one last little job, a little less dirty, a little less messy. He trusts you, Vera.{Holotape recording, now Dean's softening her up, realizes he doesn't need her as an emotional wreck... now.}
{Placating, but cold} And so do I. After this, I promise you, all those other Holotapes, they'll go away. {Holotape recording, final doomed note here. Dean's lying, he'll never stop using her or the blackmail.}
{Gloating a bit} Hey... guess who finally showed. {Malicious} You weren't on the guest list. Guess I'll need to call security, have them show you the door. {Dean warns PC they made a deadly mistake coming to get him at Theater. Invites player to become acquainted with (Holograms).}
{Relieved to see a familiar face} You... partner, are you a sight for sore eyes. Unfriendly crowd tonight, in a lethal way - if you could calm the house down, I'd be grateful. {Dean's anxious, hemmed in by lethal holograms set to kill, glad to see player, hoping the PC can bail him out.}
{Slightly irritated, still superior} Now, now... that's {emph} my room. You want your own dressing room, you have to work for it. {Dean admonishes, cynically, player when he/she goes into Dean's old dressing room in the backstage of the Theater}
{Terminal blows up} What the blazes... piece of junk! {Beat, cold, gets it} You rigged that terminal, didn't you. Didn't want security showing you out, eh? We'll see. {Dean curses, insulting the old Stage Manager's computer terminal (in the closed area of the backstage), after it blows up when he tried to use it.}
{Cold} So... can't leave well enough alone, have to enter Vera's room. Some things are better left in the past, "partner." {Player enters another dressing room backstage of a long-dead starlet Dean used to know.}
{Slightly unnerved, player's about to break his last line of defense} Don't do it. Leave that projector alone - I'm warning you. {Dean threatens PC to stop triggering the event that will disable his last line of defense against the player.}
{Slow, then challenging, bravado} So... you think you have what it takes to beat {emph} me, on {emph} my stage, in {emph} my town? Come on down, we'll see. {Dean challenges, in an act of desperation, the player to come down and hunt him.}
{Happy, excusing, then defensive} Hey, you found my old room. I mean, it's a little small... and hey, watch the hands in there, I remember where I left {emph} everything, got it?
{Working on a computer, trying to shut it down}Hnh. Maybe I can shut down these ghosts using the Stage Manager's old termin... {blows up}dammit! {Beat, frowns} Well, so much for that idea. {Dean curses, insulting old Stage Manager's computer (backstage), after blows up when tried to disable Holograms. PC's only chance to escape alive.}
{Encouraged} Hey, you're making real progress, good. {Realizes the player's close to uncovering dirty laundry, so masks it behind "show some respect"} Uh, look that's... Vera's room, so careful what you touch in there, be respectful. {Dean excited the player is making headway, even if hesitant to share his old life's links when player discovers Vera's dressing room backstage.}
{Urgent} All right, now calm the audience down and let's go home. {Beat, under his breath} And when my part plays, no cracking jokes - that was the hairstyle back then, all right? {Dean urges the player to hurry up in disabling the Theater's Hologram security, cracks joke about seeing old self perform in holograms.}
Oh, man... nice job. Good thing {emph} I was distracting them while you flicked them off. {Puffing up} We're a good team - I run the show while you run the box office. {Dean's jubilant when the Holograms vanish. He congratulates the player, although trying to make himself appear as having been stronger than he was i}
Hurry, would you? Get me out of this mess. {Beat} Got to sue my agent for this. {Dean, noticeably scared, urges the player to get him out of the Hologram mess.}
Get me out of here, they've got me trapped! {Dean, panicking, pleads to the player to save his life.}
{To himself} Hold it together, Dean, you've been in worse jams. Like Madrid. {Reflecting} Christ - Madrid. {Tries to calm himself down in the middle of being pinned down.}
{Taunt} How long you think you can keep dancing around out there? Song's going to end soon, you along with it. {Dean, a flicker of doubt in his voice, curses at the player for not having died yet.}
{Taunt} You won't get out of here alive. Even if you reach me, you don't have the guts to fight. {Dean, irritated that the player is still alive, taunts his/her resolve.}
I'm calling the tune here - this is my theater, my show, I've waited my life to get back here. You? Not even worth the time it'd take to kill you. {Dean, pretends to have the upper hand against the player, defying him/her to hurry up and die.}
I am out of here... well, not to the Villa, just out of the damn theater first chance I get.
Got to say this for Sinclair, he sure knew how to keep things locked down, the tight-assed prick.
{Under his breath, after battle in the theater} Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure.
{Looking around} Hnh. Theater's almost the same as it was.
{Looking around} This place... hasn't changed at all.
Wonder what happened to the suckers. {Frowns} Might have gotten taken away, like I did?
That audience... better lay low, get a feel for the crowd.
Good thing, someone walks in here, they're toast.
{Frustrated} First time on stage in a hundred years, and it has to be this?
{Looking around} Hnh. Theater's almost the same as it was.
Where the hell did everyone else go?
Need some help here... and that audience is {emph} not looking friendly.
Hope my partner fared better than I did... better not have left me high and dry, get-even's not going to be pretty.
So... what's your story, beautiful?
Don't... uh... don't talk much, do you?
{Sighs, irritated at being rebuffed} All right, then. I'll just wallflower it over here.
{Gently bringing it up, worried she remembers him} Eh... those scars? What happened, somebody... something carve you up, or...?
{Testing the waters} Damn shame, hate to think if someone put you in there. Who bailed you out again, the new guy? Interesting.
Look, you obviously {emph} hear good - even if you aren't much of a talker.
Don't get me wrong, that's a plus in my book.
Still, are you getting any shred of your voice healed up, or...? Like anything?
Look, you obviously {emph} hear good - even if you aren't much of a talker.
Where the hell did you get this one. "Dog?" What, so you don't forget your name?
A little slow, huh? Uh... Dean. Dean Domino. I... live here.
All right, pal, you stay in your corner, I'll stay in mine. {Beat} Do not leave me alone with this thing.
Why are you so carved up - {frowns, a little incredulous} that a {emph} bear trap on your arm?
Eh... wait, so you're not just slow, you're screwy, too? {Rolls eyes} Some crew we are... we are never getting into the Sierra Madre.
Don't like the way this guy is looking at me. You better be his leash.
{Getting angry} Stop looking at me, you idiot. I can hear your stomach growling from here, I don't like it.
That a bet you want to take? Cause I'll see that and raise you a few bullets to the skull.
I hope you've got this one under control, because he's giving me a nasty itch on my trigger finger.
{Uncertain of controls} Is... is this thing on? You hear me down there? {Beat, studying dials}Trying to help you out here... disable the speakers, play a little music... {<AUDIO: Dean speaks through player's radio-collar.><Dean tells the player that he's trying to disable the Vault's security speakers.>}
{snaps fingers as music kicks in, ohhh yeah}...and that's more like it, got a beat you can swing to. {Beat} And they won't set off your collar any more - {lower, tougher} just hit that guy where it hurts. {<AUDIO: Radio collar. Dean succeeds in disabling the Vault's security speakers.>}
{snaps fingers as music kicks in, ohhh yeah}...and that's more like it, got a beat you can swing to. {Beat} And they won't set off your collar any more - {lower, tougher} just hit that guy where it hurts. {<AUDIO: Radio collar. Dean succeeds in disabling the Vault's security speakers.>}
I'm not one for church, but there's a bell tower to the north that has a nice view of the Sierra Madre. {To himself, remembering the Cloud}Well, did, anyway. {<Dean tells the player that he's seen a bell tower to the north that should have an excellent view of the casino>}
{Sniffing air} You smell gas? I smell gas. {Beat}Might be a valve nearby, we can use it to torch any locals that come near us. {<Dean smells gas, wonders if there is a useful gas valve nearby>}
Surprised these homes weren't robbed blind, folks leaving the key out like that. {Beat, grumbles} If only the Sierra Madre'd done the same. {<Snarky comment about the house key being left outside of the locked door>}
{Whistles softly, appreciating} Now, {emph}there's a view. {To casino} Hello, beautiful. {<Stepping out onto the roof with the view of the Sierra Madre, Dean makes a comment about the view>}
{Dean Dead: Narration, a little wistful at the memory} Dean Domino, entertainer, singer... thief... had his last show on the Sierra Madre stage. {Dean is dead, narrating what happened to him at the end of the game when the end credits play.}
{Narration} The heist he spent over two hundred years planning fell apart, just as the first, by underestimating his partner's strength.
{Narration} Not long after the Courier left the Villa, the lights in the theater shut off, one by one.
{Narration} Only Dean's Hologram remained on stage, singing silently to an empty room.
{Narration, sad shaking of head, end on a downnote} Still... as consumed as he had been with its riches and ruin, the Sierra Madre had held him captive long ago. {Slow, a little sad as if shaking your head, draw this to a close.}
{Dean Alive: Narration, slightly upbeat} Dean Domino, entertainer, singer... thief... explored the Sierra Madre not long after he was rescued by the Courier. {Dean's alive during this "end credits" narration.}
{Narration} Once he left the theater, the Sierra Madre recognized him as a guest, and many doors opened to him. He had to admit, it had been built to last. {2nd part of this, slightly impressed.}
{Narration} During his search, he came across the final records of Vera and Sinclair, and realized what happened the night the bombs fell.
{Narration} He felt strangely sad for a moment, and he had no idea why. {Slightly confused. Never really got that Vera finally found love. And why that would bother him.}
{Narration} Shrugging it off, his mind turned instead to where the Courier had come from. Vegas still survived, out there in the Mojave. {Direction: Whatever, throw the line away, then make it eager-new-horizons in second half.}
{Narration} Its sights, sounds... and casinos, ripe for the taking. {Slightly eager/predatory.}
{Narration, slightly upbeat} So giving the Sierra Madre one last nod and a wink, he set off beyond the Cloud to begin again. {Slow, draw this to a close.}
{Not happy, but sees an opportunity} What are you waiting for? Rubbing it in? {Slight disgust/eager} Strike up the band already. {AUDIO: From a speaker.}
{Warning} Careful when you do... you think the Villa's bad now, you haven't seen anything yet. {AUDIO: Coming from a speaker.}
{Sees an opportunity, quiet, whispering} Come on, partner. So close now, stage is set, strike up the band. {AUDIO: From a speaker.}
{Slightly worried} Just get ready to run when you do... I sure will. {To himself} Think the Villa's bad now... you haven't seen half the hell this town can raise.
I used to know a ventriloquist with more skill than you. At least he had the sense to know his own name, without carving it into his chest.
The truth, buddy, is this: you and me, we're now family as long as we got these bowties on. So watch your mouth, you don't scare me.
Sierra Madre's mine, my heart's right where it belongs.
Sounds like you need your hearing checked. Sierra Madre, it's meant for me.
{Quiet, slightly nervous} Let's head through the hole in the wall there - if we go backstage, we avoid the locals. {<The player enters west town for the first time and Dean suggest the player head through the hole in the wall to avoid the ghost people.>}
If your marker's right, think the roost we're looking for is to the southeast. {<Tells the player that the roof with the marker is to the south east>}
{Quiet} I am all about keeping low in this section of town... so let's see about creeping by the locals, all right? {<Dean suggests finding a way to sneak around the ghost people rather than fight them>}
{To himself, sarcastic} Ah, aren't the trees lovely this time of year, all blooming and green... {<Sarcastic comment on how lovely the dead trees are this time of year>}
{Walked into a nice patio, appreciative} Nice spot for sunning. {Beat, to himself} Well, if the sun ever touched here. {<Comment about the small courtyard set up with the lawn chairs and the umbrellas>}
Don't be ridiculous - point that somewhere else, will you?
{Slightly wistful, quiet} A little party favor before the grand finale.
Watch where you're chucking those things!

Hey man, when in Rome.
I look so good in this shit, I want you to call me Fucking Spectacular from now on.
Well look who it is! Fantastic's little helper, all grown up. Following in his master's footsteps.
Guess who got promoted to goddamn dam god? The cream always rises to the top, and Fantastic always rises to the top of the cream.
What the fuck, man? Are you loco? {Talking to a psychotic person who murdered a bunch of people just now.}
You just killed my paycheck.
Who the hell are you? They bring you in to replace me? They're replacing me, aren't they?
Yo.
Newsflash. Fantastic is irreplaceable.
Whoa, really? Ho, shit! I knew I could do it. Those NCR pricks can all get on their knees and worship at the altar of fucking Fantastic!
But don't worry, I'll tell them what you did for me, man. Not all of it, though. They'd think I was an idiot. But some of it.
Keep at it, man. One day you could end up where I am. You never know.
Ah, shit. Shit, man. I need this. Gotta pay the bills. And I'm addicted to a lot of different kinds of chems. I mean a lot.
Ah, shit, man. You're direct, you're no-nonsense. How am I supposed to compete with that? I gotta pay these chem bills.
It was easy, man. They were going door to door asking if anyone knew any scientists. I said look no further.
They asked me if I knew anything about power plants. I said as much as anyone I'd ever met.
They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard.
Well hey, if you find yourself up at the mainframe, do yourself a favor and make sure you send the power to the right place.
It needs to go to the Strip and McCarran.
What else? I'm in charge. This whole operation depends on me. No Fantastic, no power. Got the whole NCR suckling my teats, and it feels so good.
No, man. I know exactly what I'm doing. I just don't know what effect it's going to have.
Over there controls power in this building. That station has readouts on the computer network.
That big knob there makes a crazy noise. Sparks come out of that slot if you put stuff in it. And I'm learning more every day.
Ah well. Guess I'll have to wait for the next curious sucker.
[SUCCEEDED] Aw, man. How am I supposed to buy chems now? Fine. Here.
[FAILED] Ha! You had me going for a second there. Then I remembered that there's only one Fantastic. I'm king of this dump.
There's these two terminals outside. They control the mirrors. I tried fooling with them but didn't get very far.
You'd have to get them to talk to the mainframe up in the tower, then do the rest from up there. I'm guessing. But it sounds good, right?
Hey, you're not thinking of going up there, are you?
Damn right, you're not. Goddamn right. Why would they? You can't top this guy. Just a little more time. You can't keep Fantastic down for long.
Damn right, you're not. Goddamn right. Why would they? You can't top this guy. Just a little more time. You can't keep Fantastic down for long.
Because I get paid, that's why. Per kilowatt-hour, whatever the hell that is. That's where the NCR wants the power, so that's where I want it.
But you know, you do that, maybe I put in a good word for you with them. Fantastic's little helper. There's a reputation you can hang your hat on.
What's it look like, man? I'm fucking king of the NCR. Caesar's Legion has Caesar, the NCR's got Fantastic. It's Fantastic's NCR now.
This whole war's about power, man. Caesar wants it. NCR wants it. Fantastic's got it.
After I fixed HELIOS One and basically saved the NCR from the dumbshits who run it, I got myself a little promotion. Now I run the whole shebang.
Whoa, hey. All right, man. It's cool. Who said anything about being your master?
I'm just the guy who tells you to do the stuff you do before you do it.
Man, what aren't my responsibilities? Dam overflow, dam underflow. Dam leakage. Sometimes the dam gets too big and I have to shrink it down. {Emph. "aren't"}
People come to me to resolve their disputes with my wisdom.
Like, hey Fantastic, who gets to keep this doodad we found? Or, yo, Fantastic, when will you accept that you're the father of my child? It's crazy.
They sure as shit did. I mean there's still formalities, like I have to run everything by Lawson before I do it.
But do I ever do that? Is his name Fantastic?
No, man. That's just what I'm supposed to do.
But when he tells me to push the middle button to divert the intake, and the right button feels nicer when I touch it, I know where my loyalty is.
Man, I just don't know how an idiot like that gets put in charge of anything.
Man, I don't even know. It's crazy.
Shh. You feel that? That's the winds of change, baby, and Fantastic's riding them with his magic angel wings.
They saw the shit I did for the NCR, how I carried them on my back, brought fire to the heathens. I wasn't gonna help them but they begged.
Well, somebody begged. Couldn't say who for sure. It's all a blur, you know? Chems, man. What a trip.
I'm working on some top secret shit I can't even tell you about, it's so mind-blowing.
But here's a little taste. You know how you can only collect sunlight during the day? What if you could make it daytime all the time?
Crazy, right? Or is it? I'm gonna find somebody smart and ask him that question, see what he says. It'll be fucking intense.
Well, see, we're getting power, because the guy running this place is Fantastic.
But the mirrors outside aren't aimed right, so we're running at one percent efficiency. And I guess that just isn't good enough for some assholes.
Trouble is, most of the controls for this place aren't here - they're in the tower.
And that place has some crazy Pre-War security system that the dumbshit NCR set off when they took over. Killed two guys. Now they won't go near it.
They want me to make an omelet, but I can't break any of their eggs, know what I'm saying?
Fuck, man. Everything. I push buttons. I turn dials. I read numbers. Sometimes I make up little stories in my head about what the numbers mean.
Like one time I imagined they were a code to get into a vault full of naked women. Man, how cool would that be?
Worried? Do I look worried to you? I've got this under control, baby. No one else can do what I do here. {In denial.}

Did you see all the commotion at REPCONN? I hope that doesn't mean trouble for our town.
Hey, there. Been to the top of the dino yet?
I could've sworn we were under attack. Did you see those rockets?
If you're planning on staying awhile, the Dino Dee-lite's got plenty of room.
I really hope that incident at REPCONN doesn't drive people away. Novac was starting to do well!
With all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
Don't listen to a word No-bark says. I don't think he ever sleeps, so it's no wonder he spouts nothing but nonsense.
Gathering junk's not the most exciting work, but it's a living.
Good thing none of those rockets crashed into Novac.
If it weren't for the water caravans, Novac would've turned to dust a long time ago.
Those rockets over at REPCONN were the NCR's doing. Trying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.

{annoyed at town conspiracy theorist}Don't listen to a word No-bark says. He spouts nothing but nonsense.
Been to the top of the dino yet?
{successful rocket launch}Good thing none of those rockets crashed into Novac.
If it weren't for the water caravans, Novac would've turned to dust a long time ago.
{Boone shot Manny}Can't believe Boone shot Manny.
{Boone shot Jeannie}Boone must've had a hell of a grudge against Jeannie-May.
{Boone shot Alice}What did Boone have against Alice?
{Boone shot Dusty}Boone thought Dusty sold Carla into slavery?
{Boone shot No-bark}No-bark was harmless. There's no way he had something to do with Boone's wife.
{Boone shot Andy}Hell of thing for Boone to kill Ranger Andy like that.
{Chupacabra killed}Looks like the McBrides weren't telling tall tales after all.
{Chupacabra alive}The McBrides think some mysterious creature is shooting up their Brahmin. Gotta be somebody in town doing it.
{rocket launch}All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
{rocket launch failed}Knew those ghouls were up to no good. Look where it got us.
Thanks for all your help.
You been real kind to us.
Just showed up out of nowhere and lended a hand. We appreciate it.

I don't much like you.
Maybe you should just move on.
You mind your business, we'll mind ours.
You're confusing to us. Why are you here?
You're kind of odd, aren't you?
How about you just do nice things for us. We liked those.

Sources at the Dam are telling us that the involvement of one key person appears to have heavily influenced the outcome.
Reports indicate that NCR forces emerged victorious, and the Legion scattered amidst the defeat of its most feared military leader.
Preliminary word is that Caesar's Legion has taken control of the Dam, and that the NCR presence in Nevada is severely crippled.
While it initially appeared to be an NCR victory, we're receiving word that our own Mr. House may have been the one to secure the Dam for himself.
But in a shocking turn of events, the Dam has been rendered useless, and both sides have taken heavy casualties. Neither faction appears to have won.

When you return topside, I think you'll see that my Securitron army is a little more than the Legion was prepared to handle.
Oh, and before you go - grab that print-out spooling from the console here - those papers set the terms for the NCR's unconditional surrender.
I thought you might enjoy the honor of presenting them to the NCR's commanding officer, once the Legion has been defeated. Cheers!
{FIRST, BUNKER, BENNY FLED} I do wish you'd come and met with me at the Lucky 38 when you first arrived on the Strip. Or after Benny fled, even.
{FIRST, BUNKER, BENNY DEAD CASINO} I do wish you'd come and met with me at the Lucky 38 when you first arrived on the Strip. Or after you killed Benny, even.
{FIRST, BUNKER} Quite an honor you spurned, my invite. You would be the first person to set foot inside the Lucky 38 in over 200 years.
{sigh of pique} But... you still wound up here, right where I wanted you. {self-satisfied} I knew I could rely on Caesar to return the Platinum Chip to you.
{LATER, BUNKER} Well! You're here ahead of schedule! I suppose it's just as well...
This is where I wanted you to end up, after all. {self-congratulating} I knew I could rely on Caesar to give you back the Platinum Chip.
{LATER, BUNKER, MISSION} I see that you reached your destination safely. Shall we get to work?
{BUNKER} Have you come to your senses? It's not too late to upload the Platinum Chip's data to the primary computer.
{BUNKER} Stop wasting time. Go upload the data on the Platinum Chip to the facility's primary computer.
{BUNKER} As you know, the Platinum Chip upgrades my Securitrons' operating software. Well... there's an army of them here.
The Securitrons policing the Strip are a fraction of the total number manufactured. The rest, I stored here.
{BUNKER} The Platinum Chip is a data-storage device.
I need you to manually upload the data from the Chip to the facility's primary computer. There's a terminal at the other end of this facility.
There's a complication. While I can broadcast to this screen, I can't control any of the facility's systems.
That means I can't deactivate its security bots... most of which appear to be active, according to the status board I'm looking at.
{BUNKER, FORT SECS DEST} {devastated} Do you have the slightest idea of what you've done, of what you've destroyed?
You've doomed Vegas to be ruled by corrupt bureaucrats or fanatical savages.
Singlehandedly, you've brought mankind's best hopes of forward progress crashing down. No punishment would be too severe.
{BUNKER} Your work here is done. Return to the Lucky 38 so we can discuss next steps.
You have a very bright future ahead of you. Thanks to your actions today, so does the rest of mankind.
{PLAYER DIDN'T GET CHIP} {Should be Securitron on the Strip} Benny is dead, and yet you don't appear to be carrying the Platinum Chip.
I don't suppose you forgot to search his body?
{LOST CHIP} Before we go any further - where is the Platinum Chip?
{FIRST, HAS CHIP, FORT SECS UP} {spoke to player at the Fort bunker first} So, we meet in person finally... so to speak. You did well at the Fort - kudos.
{HAD CHIP, REFUSED, RETURNED} Have you come to your senses - or will there be a repeat of the last incident?
{FIRST, HAS CHIP, BENNY DEAD TOPS} You've been a busy courier, haven't you? You take your obligation to deliver an package very seriously - an ethic for which I am grateful.
I will admit, when you ignored my invitation, I predicted... negative outcomes. But - you have a way of exceeding expectations, don't you?
Well enough. Let's have the Chip, then.
{FIRST, NO TOPS} {even tones, welcoming the player but appraising, too}This meeting has been a long time coming, hasn't it? You've come a long ways, literally and, I suspect, figuratively as well.
{proud of the Vegas you built} I have to ask - now that you've reached your destination, what do you make of what you see?
{FIRST, BENNY FLED} The point of my inviting you to visit me here at the Lucky 38 {emphasis} before stomping into the Tops on your own was to help you prepare - tactically.
Now, because of your carelessness, Benny has fled the Strip, taking with him the Platinum Chip.
{FIRST DISCUSS, PLAYER VISITED TOPS} {welcoming player, trying to hide irritation} Well... this meeting has been a long time in coming... longer still, since you took time to {disapproving} charge into the Tops before coming to see me.
{putting aside irritation} Before we get down to details, I must ask - now that you've arrived at your destination, what do you make of what you see?
{NO TERMS, NO TOPS} {player walked away without accepting terms last time} Can I look forward to a more {beat, emphasis} substantial conversation this time?
{TERMS, NO TOPS} Have you considered the terms of my offer? There's else little for us to discuss until you have.
{TERMS YES, NO CHIP} What is the purpose of this delay?
{LATER, BENNY FLED} Events have transpired in a... {beat} less-than-optimal fashion. Benny has fled the Strip, and the Platinum Chip has not been recovered.
{LATER, BENNY FLED} Benny must be pursued, and the Platinum Chip, recovered.
{LATER, HAS CHIP, BENNY DEAD TOPS} So... Benny has been {slight beat} handled and you've recovered the Platinum Chip. Let's have it.
{LATER, HAS CHIP} I take it you've come to deliver the Platinum Chip?
{HOUSE RECEIVES CHIP} {tenderly regarding the Chip} Such a small thing, isn't it? And yet so... {capacious = inexhaustibly capable} capacious. So very dear.
Decades of hiring salvagers out west to search for this little {beat} relic in the ruins of a place called Sunnyvale. Back then, anyway.
That's where the Chip was printed, on October 22, 2077. It was to have been hand-delivered to me here, at the Lucky 38, the next day.
But the bombs fell first. Suffice it to say, the delivery was never made.
{CHIP IN, STRIP SECS NO} {jaunty, eager to share your secret} Come now, come now... get thee to the elevator.
{CHIP IN, STRIP SECS NO} {growing impatient} To the elevator, if you please... Stop dragging your feet.
{STRIP SECS UP} {dry} Trips to the basement are rarely so educational, don't you think?
I've since broadcast the upgrade to every Securitron in range of my transmitters, and I must say, it's causing quite a stir down on the Strip!
{L38, HAS BUNKER MISSION} Make your way to Caesar's Camp at Fortification Hill. Something very interesting awaits you...
{STRIP SECS UP, GIVES BUNKER MISSION} To secure the future of New Vegas, I must have your assistance. The work ahead is dangerous, but {beat} you weather danger well.
{STRIP SECS UP} Have you found the courage to do what's necessary?
{MQN, B4 CHIP} What did you wish to know?
{MQN, B4 CHIP} What else did you want to know?
{FORT SECS NO} We'll talk again once you've concluded your work in the bunker at Fortification Hill.
{FORT SECS UP} The foundation is laid. My Securitrons on the Strip are upgraded, and those at the Fort, ready for action.
Now it's just a matter of adjusting the attitudes of some lesser groups while we wait for Caesar's Legion to attack Hoover Dam.
{PLAYER HASN'T ACCEPTED BOOMER QUEST YET} The next step is to add the Boomers' considerable firepower to my growing arsenal... or at the very least, ensure their neutrality.
As I was saying, I need you to enlist or neutralize the Boomers at Nellis Air Force Base.
{BOOMERS QUEST ACTIVE} Any progress with the Boomers?
Your next assignment won't take you far. It concerns the Omertas and their den of vice, Gomorrah.
As the decisive encounter between the bull and the bear looms close, my concerns about the Omertas have grown.
I've never expected loyalty, mind you. A reliably underhanded tribe is just as constant to deal with as one that always run true.
But that's just it - lately the Omertas' cooperative silence has been deafening. Not a single complaint? They're up to something.
Your next assignment would've been to investigate the Omertas, but you managed to foil their scheme before I could put you to the task.
I should compensate you as though it were an official assignment, however. Wouldn't want to {beat} disincentivize your proactivity.{cash out Omerta quest}
I'd hoped to have you investigate the Omertas, but after the trouble you caused at Gomorrah, they won't let you in the front door.
I'll see if I can make some progress with informants. You're useless in this matter.
As I said before, I need you to investigate the Omertas, to see what they're up to.
What do you have to report about the Omertas?
Your next assignment is to locate and destroy remnants of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel.
The NCR nearly did the job at Helios One a few years ago, but there seem to have been survivors, unfortunately.
Given the Brotherhood's fanatical views on technology, they can be counted on to oppose my regime.
Please - put them out of my misery.
As I've said, I need you to locate and destroy the Brotherhood of Steel.
Have you destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel?
Will you ensure that President Kimball survives his visit to Hoover Dam?
{ALL REPUTATIONS LEAD-IN} Aaron Kimball, the president of the New California Republic, is going to visit Hoover Dam to "boost morale."
Apparently he hasn't considered the effect on the troops' morale of seeing their beloved leader get his brains blown out by a Legion sniper.
{GOOD REP LEAD-IN} I need you to make sure that no harm comes to President Kimball. It's fortunate that you've maintained good relations with the NCR...
{NCR REPUTATION TERRIBLE} Unfortunately, I can't use you to protect Kimball. The NCR won't let you come within a thousand feet of the President.
Odds are that Caesar will launch his assault on the dam after Kimball's visit is concluded, one way or the other - so be on guard.
Last I knew, President Kimball wasn't scheduled to visit the Lucky 38. Be on your way to Hoover Dam, will you?
If not for you, President Kimball would be dead. So you needn't feel guilty when the NCR's rout from Hoover Dam demolishes his political career.
Why in the world did you attack President Kimball?
Kimball is dead - what a mess you've made!
{GIVES EL DORADO SUBSTATION QUEST} Between the Strip and HELIOS One lies the El Dorado electrical substation.
Humble as it appears, the substation has immense strategic value, for it's there that you'll jumpstart the Lucky 38's dormant reactor.
Gain access to the substation's control room and install this override module. Just so you know, there are NCR troops guarding the station.
Until the Lucky 38's reactor has been restarted, we have nothing to discuss.
As you can see, Vegas is humming along. I've tested my c3i broadcasting arrays. Everything is in order.
And just in time, as it turns out. The forces of Caesar's Legion are on the march, establishing a staging area east of the dam.
Their assault could begin at any moment. So that's where you'll be heading, if you're ready - Hoover Dam.
The Legion's assault could begin at any moment.
{MQN, STRIP SECS UP} What did you want to discuss?
{MQN, STRIP SECS UP} What else did you want to discuss?
{Player fled combat last time} There will be no repeat of the trouble we had last time, I trust?
{Player fled combat last time} I'm optimistic that this conversation will go more smoothly.
{MQN, FORT SECS UP} I'd rather you just dealt with the Boomers, but all right...
{MQN, FORT SECS UP} I suppose the Omertas can wait a few minutes.
{MQN, FORT SECS UP} A few questions, and then you'll handle the Brotherhood, I hope?
{MQN, FORT SECS UP} Questions like "Will President Kimball survive his visit to Hoover Dam?"
{MQN, FORT SECS UP} Even now? On the brink of battle?
[SUCCEEDED] Very well... five times your delivery bonus - {with finality}not one cap more.
[FAILED] Is that an attempt at...{beat} {distaste} humor?
I've always taken business negotiations seriously. I advise you to do the same.
You can't - but the Chip can. The hatch will recognize the Platinum Chip and "open sesame."
You'll need a disguise, then. Or overwhelming firepower. Whatever works.
Sorry for the inconvenience, but it can't be helped. This is too important.
Of course you haven't. Vegas always was one of a kind.
What you see down on the Strip is just a fraction of the city's former glory, and yet... {beat} more than an echo. I preserved its spirit.
Or perhaps you were referring to the Lucky 38? The years haven't been kind to her, but still she manages to impress.
{not buying it} Oh, come now - don't play the fool. Vegas has fools enough, a superfluity of them. They're what makes it so profitable.
They come to Vegas chasing penny-ante dreams of high-living, to feel like they're big shots, like they're winners.
You see that you and I are of a different stripe, don't you? We don't have to {emphasis} dream that we're important. We {emphasis} are.
{arch} You aren't going to ramble on about the virtues of life out in the wastes, are you? It's a desert, you do realize?
A radioactive desert where humans subsist in a barbaric state? Difficult to glorify convincingly. They are, however, aptly named.
For that's what you'd be out there - wasted. Here on the Strip, your talents can be put to use.
Oh, by all means - yes. That's refreshing.
The business is this. One of my employees has stolen an item of extraordinary value from me, and I want it recovered.
Simple enough?
You're ready to move forward, then?
Oh, don't be coy. You've been playing a high-stakes game ever since Victor dug you out of the ground. Don't be afraid to admit it.
Yes, I know. It was detected immediately and deactivated... let's see... 39.735 seconds after you planted it.
You thought I wouldn't notice?
One of the Followers of the Apocalypse, I'm sure. They're curious about me.
Good luck planting a surveillance device here in the Lucky 38 without my knowing about it.
Precisely. You'll have no trouble joining the battle on their side, and they'll be too distracted to notice why you're really there.
{disappointed} A crude question, crudely asked.
I'll be happy to satisfy your {disapproving} rambunctious curiosity at a more appropriate moment. But now, I'll repeat my question...
What do you make of what you've seen?
Why didn't {emphasis} Victor intervene sooner, you mean?
Goodsprings is a bit too far away for me to reliably control a Securitron agent by remote. I can send and receive packets of data, at best.
Victor's combat algorithms determined the proper course of action. Benny and his thugs were more than a match for a lone Securitron.
When he alerted me, I instructed him to approach the site after Benny and the others had departed.
I've resurrected Vegas, spirit intact. What I need now is the ability to enforce my rightful claim.
Not just against Caesar's Legion, by the way. In fact, the NCR is a more present and insidious threat.
To enforce, one must have force - a position of strength.
Years ago, when I detected NCR scouts roaming the Mojave, I could tell from their uniforms that these were no mere tribesmen.
I knew it was only a matter of time before an army appeared, to take control of the dam. And I knew my Securitrons wouldn't be enough to oppose them.
And so I recruited the Three Families. Vegas belongs to me because I mustered enough strength to bring the NCR to the bargaining table.
Indeed it was - and still is. But not without taking significant casualties.
Would Kimball and Oliver have traded the lives of hundreds of soldiers for absolute control of Hoover Dam? Oh yes.
They weren't afraid of me, they were afraid of Caesar - that attacking me would leave them vulnerable to a Legion offensive.
And so they negotiated. Not out of the kindness of their hearts, as they try to make it seem. Because the calculus of power left no other choice.
NCR forces were permitted to occupy Hoover Dam and establish a military base at McCarran Airport. {not an airport anymore} Well, it used to be one.
They recognized my sovereignty over the Vegas Strip and agreed to supply electricity and water once their engineers repaired the dam.
Written into the treaty were provisions that the NCR do nothing to prevent its soldiers and civilians from visiting the Strip.
That's how I harnessed the NCR to my endeavor. Their occupation has been the engine of my growing economy.
The salient issue is that they will go to war with me, if given the chance.
There's just one reason why the NCR hasn't contrived some outrage to justify invading the Strip - Caesar's Legion.
The final battle between those two armies is fast approaching. I can't afford to let either side win on their terms.
New Vegas is more than a city - it's the remedy to mankind's {beat}derailment.
The city's economy is a blast furnace in which can be forged the steel of a new rail line, running straight to a new horizon.
What is the NCR? A society of people desperate to experience comfort, ease, luxury... A society of customers.
With all that money pouring in? Give me 20 years, and I'll reignite the high technology development sectors. 50 years, and I'll have people in orbit.
100 years, and my colony ships will be heading for the stars, to search for planets unpolluted by the wrath and folly of a bygone generation.
I prefer the term "autocrat."
I would rule as a chief executive. I would not answer to a board of directors or any other entity.
Nothing to impede progress. If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows.
My judgement.
I have no interest in abusing others, just as I have no interest in legislating or otherwise dictating what people do in their private time.
Nor have I any interest in being worshipped as some kind of machine god messiah. I am impervious to such corrupting ambitions.
But autocracy? Firm control in the hands of a technological and economic visionary? Yes, that Vegas shall have.
I'm sure the assassins will wait for you to show up.
Our terms were clear. Now that you have the Chip in your possession, any attempt to "re-negotiate" payment would be tantamount to blackmail.
To achieve my aims, I require a capable human agent to perform certain... {choosing word} tasks.
I knew Benny was ambitious, even ruthless. But I believed he would do the job, so long as he was incentivized appropriately.
Obviously, I miscalculated his drive for supremacy. But in any case, you've come along - a more-than-suitable replacement.
{satisfied} Well enough. Return to me when you have the Platinum Chip in your possession. Any final matters for us to discuss?
My only concern is the recovery of the Platinum Chip. What happens to Benny, I leave to your discretion.
When you bring the Chip to me, I will pay you four times the delivery bonus stipulated in your contract. How's that?
As I said before, Benny's fate is yours to decide. Once you've delivered the Chip, I will pay you the amount agreed-upon.
Benny has led the Chairmen ever since I recruited his tribe seven years ago.
Until his recent misbehavior, I'd planned to make him my protege. Maybe if I'd begun grooming him sooner, none of this would've happened...
My offer far exceeds the original terms of your contract, which, I will remind you, already obligate you to deliver the Chip.
[SUCCEEDED] Very well, five times the bonus. {with finality} Not one cap more.
[FAILED] Is that an attempt at...{beat} {distaste} humor?
I've always taken business negotiations very seriously. I advise you to do the same. {Duplicate.}
It's a very special item. There's nothing else like it in the entire world. It was lost a long time, and difficult to find.
That's all you need to know about it, for this stage of our enterprise. Fulfill your contract, deliver the Chip, and good things will come your way.
Well enough. Be on your way.
Benny was the leader of the Chairmen for seven years, ever since I recruited the tribe. I considered him something of a protege.
I am Robert Edwin House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip.
I oversaw the city's renovations starting from 2274 onward. The Three Families are my employees.
Before the Great War of 2077, I was the founder, President and CEO of RobCo Industries, a vast computer and robotics corporation.
It's understandable that you'd be curious about this topic, but we'll hold off until the Platinum Chip has been recovered.
{drawn out} Hmm... {to yourself} How shall I put this?
{taking time, spelling it out} Delivery of the Platinum Chip is non-negotiable.
I invite you to think carefully about what you do next... standing alone before me, surrounded by my heavily-armed Securitron guards.
{restraining anger} By the time I was 30 years old, I was a billionaire 30 times over. I founded and ran a vast economic empire.
{restraining anger} Do you really think I'm going to let an upstart come into my home and ransom my property to me?
{restraining anger, losing it a little towards end} I spent two centuries searching for the Platinum Chip. It's my invention, my property - mine. Now be a good courier and deliver it!
{sarcastic} Why, thank you so much. You played that {beat} very poorly, you realize?
You're fortunate that I have a certain {beat} tolerance for greed. I expect my business partners to be self-interested - but {unlike you} smartly so.
{ordering attack} You needn't be afraid of me. It's my Securitrons that are going to kill you.
Not if you've been invited. You realize that you've made quite a splash here in New Vegas?
I can predict with a high degree of confidence that you'll receive an official summons from Caesar. If you haven't already, that is.
[SUCCEEDED] You might keep an eye out for any computers that Benny's been using. Maybe even a computer lab of some sort...
[FAILED] You have a contract to fulfill, a delivery to make.
If you can't hold to a contract, simply for the ethic of holding to a contract, you're worthless to me.
I want you to open a hatch in the basement of the derelict weather station atop Fortification Hill.
You'll recognize it on sight. The hatch bears the logo of the Lucky 38, same as the Platinum Chip.
Don't let the video screens and computer terminals fool you. I'm flesh and blood, not silicon.
[SUCCEEDED] I see you've made a study of the topic. My knowledge of the science of longevity would fill several text books...
Perhaps, after a decade or two of economic reconstruction, I can commercialize these technologies and offer to others, such as yourself.
[FAILED] No. While brains demonstrated some use as organic processors in the robots produced by General Atomics International...
They never retained personality once removed from the human body.
Let's just say it was very... {beat} costly. But I was willing to make the sacrifices longevity entailed, financial and otherwise.
I'm not surprised. The Legion has spies on the Strip.
Until then.
{nonplussed} You have? So you have the means to gain entry?
If you find Caesar's Legion so frightening at this remove, imagine them rampaging across the Strip.
We have a chance to see them destroyed, to see New Vegas become the harbinger of a new age.
This is not the time for Q&A. Kindly hand over the Chip. {DUPLICATE}
This is not the time for Q&A. Kindly hand over the Chip. {DUPLICATE}
We've accomplished a great deal, you and I. One last task, and our work is complete. I'll see you in the control room.
{tense} Then handle them with dispatch. The Legion's assault is imminent.
So you've said before. You're making a habit of wasting my time.
You signed a contract in good faith to deliver that Chip. You're going to have a hard time on the Strip if you are so incautious of making enemies...
{impatient} Please focus on the task at hand - for both our sakes.
No, you haven't.
This is the second time you've promised to deliver the Platinum Chip. Even if you don't hold yourself to your promises, I will.
I'm not offering you an incentive as crude as money - though there'll be plenty of that.
What I'm offering you is a ground-floor opportunity in the most important enterprise on Earth.
What I'm offering is a future - for you, and for what remains of the human race.
You are the first person to step foot inside the Lucky 38 in over 200 years. It was not an invitation I made lightly.
We have a serious matter to discuss, concerning a contract you have yet to fulfill.
You have an "interest" in this, whether you like it or not. You signed a contract to deliver the Platinum Chip to me. {seething}
{you need the player; threats won't work} Now, I could stop you from leaving, but what would that accomplish? If you want to go, go.
See what the Strip I built - the Strip I own - has to offer. Think about what I could offer you. I expect we'll have occasion to talk again.
I have to think that he found out about the Platinum Chip and mistakenly convinced himself that he could use it to his own ends.
One of the problems of a tribal work force, I'm afraid. No intuitive understanding of how complex technologies can be.
That's simply not true.
I am the only person to hold any rights pertaining to the Chip. I designed it, and I paid for it - dearly.
To develop that Chip, I spent a sum of U.S. dollars - not the bottle caps that pass as currency these days - but a sum beyond counting.
For decades, I paid salvagers to comb the ruins for it. And when it was finally discovered, tens of thousands of caps spent to have it brought here.
We know how that turned out. Complete your contract and it will be the last time I pay for the Chip. Save your questions for then.
You realize you were just one of many couriers, the rest of them {beat}dummies, so to speak?
Add to that many thousands of caps worth of mercenary protection to screen your avenue of approach.
Had I used an armed caravan to transport the Chip, I might as well have been announcing to the world "this is important. Attack this!"
I didn't want to attract the attention of groups like the Great Khans or the Brotherhood of Steel. Alas, the real threat was closer to home.
Frontal assaults on casinos? Not good for business.
In any case, Benny would see it coming. And all he'd have to do is hold the Chip up and point a pistol at it.
Our foremost advantage is that Benny doesn't know that I know he has the Chip - let's not squander it.
Then Vegas shall be lost, and with it, mankind's best hope for long-term survival.
To your untrained eyes, it may look as though mankind is making a comeback. In the NCR, you have something that remsembles a nation state. {Look around you. How can the human race have a future when it's still living in the wreckage of its past?}
Savage as it is, in Caesar's Legion, you have an organized society. But neither of these offer a future. They're regurgitations of the past.
Bring me the Platinum Chip, and in ten years you'll hardly recognize this city.
It won't be easy... Benny is always surrounded by at least four bodyguards - except when he's in his private suite on the 13th floor of the Tops...
If you were to approach Benny in public, you might be able to leverage his fear of exposure to make him agree to meet with you in private.
Sneaking into Benny's suite on the 13th floor would be very difficult... but not impossible.
There might be guards. Certainly there'd be a sturdy lock on his front door.
It's more complicated than that. The Chairmen share what you might call a... {beat} tribal affinity.
Look for a man named Swank, Benny's second-in-command. He's always been a reliable, if unimaginative, employee.
Do your best to convince him that you're working under my auspices. If you have evidence of Benny's crimes, show it to him.
By contract, Securitrons are to enter the casinos only when invited by the Three Families or if other extraordinary circumstances arise.
The moment I send one into the Tops, Benny will know I'm on to him.
We can discuss this in greater detail at another time. Suffice it to say that when my Securitrons detected NCR scouts at Hoover Dam, I took action.
I recruited a tribal force to supplement my Securitrons and renovated the Strip just in time to welcome the NCR as it marched into the region.
Instead of war, a treaty was negotiated. And the money started to pour in.
You're making me question your usefulness, you realize.
Success depends on forethought, dispassionate calculation of probabilites, accounting for every stray variable.
Your history of aggression towards the NCR has rendered you useless in this concern, unable to influence the outcome of events.
Consequently, I have to "wait and see" what happens. It's... grotesque.
Well enough. We can put the past behind us, I think.
{exasperated sigh} Then this is a waste of time.
{FORT SECS NO} A great deal shall be happening - a cascade of events, with you taking a central role.
At the moment, however, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level. You'll understand soon enough...
{FORT SECS UP} A great deal shall be happening - a cascade of events, with you taking a central role.
At the moment, however, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level.
What you see there will help you understand the significance of what you accomplished at the Fort.
{FORT SECS UP} Yes, so far as you've seen, all it does is change the picture on the Securitrons' face screens from policemen to soldiers. But as you'll see...
Some things are more easily shown than told. Take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level, and you'll see what I mean.
Don't worry, you'll like what you see. We have much to accomplish, you and I...
{FORT SECS UP} I must insist that you stay long for me to show you that the Platinum Chip does more than change the pictures on the Securitrons' face screens.
Events of great import are about to unfold, with you taking a central role. To get started, all you need do is take the elevator all the way down...
I must insist that you stay long for me to show you what the Chip does. I promise you'll like what you see...
Events of great import are about to unfold, with you taking a central role.
To get started, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level...
Not interested? {louder} Not interested?
You have an interest in this even if you're too stupid to know it. If you have an interest in breathing, you have an interest in this.
Return to the Fort and do whatever it takes to recover the Chip.
I'm surprised you can still underestimate me after everything you've seen.
I haven't shown my hand - I've shown one card. I've given my enemies a single, provocative datum upon which to fixate.
They have no idea what other cards I'm holding. It's a strong hand, believe me - I dealt it to myself.
Why would I want to go to war against the NCR? They're my best customers.
If their leaders weren't scheming to steal Vegas out from under me, I'd have no troubles with the NCR at all.
No no no, you'll want to hear this out...
Disappointing. In the extreme.
The next step will require you to infiltrate Caesar's camp at Fortification Hill.
You'll have to return to Caesar's camp at Fortification Hill.{Player got Chip at CL Fort, didn't activate bunker army}
Do you have any idea how prodigious is the opportunity you're casting aside here?
Here, take the Platinum Chip again. You will need it.
Upon arrival at the Fort, it's likely that you'll be searched and the Chip taken from you. Don't worry - it will come back to you.
I expect that if Benny doesn't have the Chip, Caesar will make sure you get it. More on that later. Be off.
Then look harder.
I don't employ you to uncover evidence. This isn't a court of law.
If the Omertas pose a threat to the physical or economic security of the Vegas Strip, I want you to do whatever it takes to neutralize that threat.
Something very important. I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise - so don't bother asking.
Well done. They won't be causing any trouble, then.
The Legion has nothing left to wait for. Their assault on the dam could begin at any moment.
Before that happens, I'll ask you to complete one other task. It may seem trivial, but that's far from the case.
Well done. The Boomers' firepower may prove an advantage when the battle for Hoover Dam comes around.
It seems diplomacy is not your forte.
Given the strength of your past performance, I think we can let this go without further comment. I'm pulling you on to a new assignment.
{dry} An opinion you expressed with supreme subtlety and finesse. Moving on...
There's more than one way to skin a cat, as the saying goes. {beat} Or {emphasis} went, that is - cats being extinct.
I don't promote political assassination as a first option, but it has a long and storied history. I'll consider the Boomers neutralized.
That's because he ceased to be relevant when you recovered the Platinum Chip. Revenge doesn't interest me, progress does.
Sorry to deny you a moment of primate triumph, but you'll have to go elsewhere to sound your barbaric yawp.
{cross} There's a job that needs doing here, and I'm assigning it to you.
{sarcastic} Marvellous work ethic, bravo.
I'll send a Securitron ahead to meet with the NCR at the security checkpoint and get things started.
Once you get there ask for Ranger Grant. I've used roaming Securitrons to feed him useful information in the past.
If I tell him we've heard of a Legion assassination plot, I believe he'll let you investigate.
Singlehandedly destroying a Brotherhood of Steel bunker is quite an accomplishment. Platoons of NCR troops have died, trying to do the same.
This welcome news comes just in time, as events in the wider world are coming to a head...
This is not an optional assignment. Kimball may be a grandstanding boor, but I want him protected.
I'll give you time to think over the consequences of what you're saying. I urge you to reconsider.
Until you do this, consider yourself suspended... without pay.
Not surprising. Also not acceptable.
I didn't ask you to tell me what they were planning, I asked you to kill them. This was a waste of time.
Go back to the bunker and destroy it. My directions have been clear from the start.
{not buying it} This is no time to be droll...
Your "accident" has jeopardized the success of this entire concern.
Up to this point, your efforts yielded near-perfect results. But now I'm forced to fumble in the dark - to gamble.
Light must be brought to this darkness.
Your impulsivity has jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
Your incompetence has jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
Every step of my plan has been precisely calculated and was, until now, well-executed.
What of it? I enjoy them. There's something about a little diorama set inside a glass dome that I... {beat} find pleasing.
If you run across any out in the wastes, turn them in to Jane. She'll compensate you.
I much prefer working with robots...
You'll have to be more specific.
{shocked at magnitude of Omerta plot} And how do you know this?
{quiet outrage} I see. So where does that put us?
Absolutely not! Caesar is of great use to me.
I don't want you harming a hair on that man's head - assuming you can find one.
[SUCCEEDED] In that case, I commend you for your initiative. What do you recommend for next steps?
[FAILED]{quiet rage} And you assisted them? That's what you mean to say, isn't it?
I'll be happy to satisfy your every curiosity once the Platinum Chip has been delivered.
This is not the time for Q&A. Kindly hand over the Chip.
Fine - give me the Chip, and I'll pay you four times the delivery bonus stipulated in your contract. How's that?
Goodbye.
Outside New Vegas, at what was once called Nellis Air Force Base, resides an unusual tribe known as the Boomers.
They are, shall we say, {understating} aggressively reclusive? They have several howitzers they fire at anyone who dares approach the base.
Artillery of this sort has a range of several miles. If it's going to fire on Hoover Dam, I want it firing at my targets.
If not, then I want to make sure that the Boomers don't sign similar treaties to fire their guns in support of the NCR or Caesar's Legion.
I offer many benefits, but vacation time isn't one of them.
{first Benny, now the player} Why is good help so impossible to find?
Use extreme caution when approaching the base. Their firepower is... considerable.
Recently, one of my roaming Securitrons observed a man near the base studying the pattern of its artillery fire. Maybe he's learned something.
You laid the foundation for my victory, so fine - I'll permit some {beat, begrudging} latitude in how you schedule your work.
You're welcome.
The Omertas are fanatically loyal to each other. Still, among any group, one can find the occasional degenerate.
Gomorrah's receptionist happens to be one. For years she passed on whispers of what was taking place at the casino, in exchange for payment.
A few months ago, she clammed up. Odds are she's scared, but I've had no way of approaching her. Start with her.
The print-out I've given you lists every lead I've been able to uncover. See what you can find out.
After all that we've accomplished?
Arrogance was their undoing. {referring to the player} There might be a lesson in that. But moving on...
Indeed. Moving on...
{sigh of impatience - oh, the burden of intelligence} The Platinum Chip unlocks this bunker. Hence, you have it.
Hence, Benny was captured or killed - possibly by you, but by my estimates, far more probably by Caesar's Legion. Hence, Caesar gave you the Chip.
Hence, Caesar wants you to destroy whatever you find in this bunker.
{sigh of impatience - oh, the burdens of intelligence} That you were searched very thoroughly when you arrived at the Fort is a certainty. And as the Chip is a little too large to be {beat, implying hiding it up rectum}secreted away...
I also regard it a certainty that the Chip was discovered, taken from you, and given to Caesar - who returned it to you.
Two plus two equaling four, Caesar wants you to destroy whatever you find in this bunker.
But that's not going to happen, because {confident, not bossy} you're going to work for me.
{are you dense?} That's rather obvious, isn't it?
{don't play dumb} Surely you know that I am Robert Edwin House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip.
I oversaw the city's renovations starting from 2274 onward. The Three Families are my employees.
It was a place of splendor. As magnificent as today's Strip may seem, it's but a shadow of the neon paradise that was Las Vegas.
I grew up not far from here, and though I traveled the old world extensively, I never found another place like it.
By 2065 I deemed it a mathematical certainty that an atomic war would devastate the Earth within 15 years. Every projection I ran confirmed it.
I knew I couldn't "save the world," nor did I care to. But I could save Vegas, and in the process, perhaps, save mankind.
I set to work immediately. I thought I had plenty of time to prepare. As it turned out, I was 20 hours short.
On the day of the Great War, 77 atomic warheads targeted Las Vegas and its surrounding areas.
My networked mainframes were able to predict and force-transmit disarm code subsets to 59 warheads, neutralizing them before impact.
Laser cannons mounted on the roof of the Lucky 38 destroyed another 9 warheads. The rest got through, though none hit the city itself.
A sub-optimal performance, admittedly. If only the Platinum Chip had arrived a day sooner...
The Platinum Chip was printed in Sunnyvale, California on October 22nd, 2077 - the day before the Great War.
It was to have been delivered by courier the following afternoon... but by then, the world had ended.
The Chip contained vital software upgrades, but not just for my Securitrons. Every aspect of the missile defense grid would have been upgraded, too.
Given that I had to make do with buggy software, the outcome could have been worse. I nearly died as it was.
Software glitches set off a cascade of system crashes. I had to take the Lucky 38's reactor offline, lest it melt down.
For nearly five years I battled power outages and more system crashes until I finally managed to reboot my data core with an older version of the OS.
I spent the next few decades in a veritable coma. But I survived, obviously - and eventually thrived.
{impatient to make progress} It's a facility I built many years before you were born. You might think of it as a kind of barracks. You'll understand soon enough.
It's a facility I built many years before you were born. You might think of it as a barracks. You'll understand soon enough.
Was that meant to be a shocking revelation? Of course Caesar wants it destroyed - he's afraid of what the bunker might hold, and rightly so.
But you're not going to do that. You're going to do the smart thing, and work for me.
{steely} I don't respond well to threats. {moving on} Now, where were we...?
[SUCCEEDED] Fine, you'll receive a nice bonus when the work is done. And speaking of getting it done...
[FAILED] You signed a contract to deliver the Platinum Chip, and you'll be paid when the delivery is made.
Good. I won't hold you up any longer.
I like to think you have enough sense to do the right thing. The rewards for doing so are immense... as are the punishments for not doing so.
So what are you doing here? Return to the Fort at once.
Recover the Platinum Chip. Once you've entered the bunker hidden beneath the weather station, you'll receive further instructions.
Are you a child? The Platinum Chip was taken from you, obviously.
That would make for a welcome change.
Then gather together the firepower or explosives or whatever else you need and improvise.
I don't care if you have to kill every Legionary at the Fort. Get the job done.
By my calculations, his death will affect the shape of the battle for Hoover Dam minimally, if at all.
The Legion's aggression will outlive Caesar. Indeed, they'll try to take the dam as a tribute to his memory.
Given a year, they'd have him deified - but by then the Legion will be breaking down, riven by internal conflicts, a monster consuming itself.
It's irrelevant. In the short term, the Legion is still monster enough that defeating it will make me look powerful indeed.
{stating the obvious} Hoover Dam, of course. A hydroelectric dam?
The NCR had it up and running at 50% capacity within a year of occupying the dam. By treaty, New Vegas receives 5% of its output - more than enough.
I'll expect to see some tangible progress before long, then.
I recommend following the Securitron's instructions. Its programming is... {beat} strict, and I don't have time to change it.
Cannibalism was strictly forbidden in their contract. If some of them broke that stricture, they deserved whatever punishment you dealt them.
{perturbed} No, I was not aware of this.
Is it really so hard {emphasis} not to engage in cannibalism? My goodness...
It's a violation of their contract. I authorize you to deal with them in any way you see fit.
{not going to deny it} Yes, of course. But refraining from those "dietary practices" is a primary requirement of their contract.
They've been good to their word. Put together one hell of a resort hotel, too.
From what I hear, I'd want to eat at the Gourmand every night... if I were ambulatory.
Goodbye? Is that some kind of joke? You barely understand what I want you to accomplish down there.
I've spent too many years waiting for this moment to see it fumbled by an insubordinate contractor.
I can't reach through this monitor and compell you to follow instructions, but know this - if you disappoint me, you will pay for it.
It is obvious to you that I built this place? The Platinum Chip opened it, after all?{sigh - the burdens of intelligence}
In any case, you're here. So let's get to it.
My army will do what an army does best - defend territory from invaders... and maintain order.
The same equipment failure that prevents me from remotely operating this facility seems to have activated its security robots and turrets.
There's a security room near the base of the stairs... perhaps you can deactivate them yourself.
Listen to me, very carefully. I've waited too long for this moment for you to go fouling it up on a lark.
Do as I say, and your rewards will be immense. Thwart me, and your punishment will become the purpose of my existence.
Then there will be no safe haven for you.{monitor goes dark}
I see - you're in a predicament.
Just off the turbine room down below are three power regulators. It's a redundant system - only one is needed.
Go ahead and destroy one. The explosion will be large enough to be heard and felt aboveground.
{lying} The bunker will be destroyed, and you'll die instantly.
I'm the person who will pay you when you complete the delivery contract you signed. Now go get the Chip.
{stating the obvious} Excellent idea.
By "goodbye," I assume you mean to say that you can't talk right now because you need to go get the Platinum Chip off Benny's body.
There will time for questions and answers once you've delivered the Chip. Until then, you'll have to tolerate your ignorance... just as I do.
His destination is hardly a mystery. It's a near certainty that he's making his way for Caesar's camp, at Fortification Hill.
It's one of just two places on Earth that have the hardware necessary to read the Platinum Chip - the Lucky 38 is the other, of course.
And whose idea was it to offer yourself up as a sacrificial lamb? Really, what did you expect?
Are you going to keep giving him opportunities to kill you? It's becoming a hobby of his.
I suspected he'd found a way to access my encrypted databases, but well - this explains it.
That would be how he learned of the Platinum Chip in the first place... not to mention where to intercept you, on your way in.
Highly resourceful, Benny. He would've made a fine agent, had he stayed loyal. It's fortunate you came along to replace him - and ironic.
As I've told you before, you are contractually obligated to deliver the Chip. Do your job - you have everything to gain.
I won't lie to you. It'll be dangerous.
What about him? He has every reason to go to the Fort, so that's where you'll find him.
All I ask is that you recover the Chip. What happens to Benny is up to you.
Come back when you have something to report.
{nonplussed} And why would you have done that?
Success depends on forcing the NCR to rout from Hoover Dam. Hmm, does giving then a powerful ally in the battle make that more or less likely?
Your assignment is unchanged - destroy the Brotherhood of Steel. Please get it right this time.
Hidden Valley is the place to keep working, then.
They occupied Nellis Air Force Base a little over 50 years ago. One of my Securitrons got some video of their arrival - and then... exploded.
Odds are they were Vault dwellers. That's everything I know about them, really.
Only if you come within a mile or so of them.
Given their history of extreme isolationism, it's tempting to leave them be. But those howitzers of theirs...
You can't let indeterminate variables rattle around in your equations like that. They have to be accounted for, one way or another.
Yes, though at the time they called themselves the "Slither Kin." A vicious clan, not that that's changed, exactly.
They were nomads, capable fighters, but their specialty was betrayal. They'd invite travelers into their yurts, drug them, murder or enslave them.
They took pride in their craft. I don't think Omertas saw other people as people at all. Everyone else was just... prey.
They reminded me of a certain criminal element Vegas used to attract. I told them some stories, gave them some clothes - and they ran with it.
The Chairmen, as we know them now, went by the unfortunate appellation of the "Mojave Boot-Riders." They were nomads, too.
As for the White Glove Society, I afraid I'm contractually obligated not to reveal their original name.
They're a terrorist group, basically. Militant, quasi-religious fanatics obsessed with hoarding Pre-War technology.
Not all technology, mind you. You don't see them raiding hospitals to cart away Auto-Docs or armfuls of prosthetic organs.
No, they greatly prefer the sort of technology that {emphasis} puts people in hospitals. Or graves, rather, since hospitals went the way of the Dodo.
Because they're ridiculous! Because they galavant around the Mojave pretending to be Knights of Yore.
Or did, until the NCR showed them that ideological purity and shiny power armor don't count for much when you're outnumbered 15:1.
The world has no use for emotionally unstable techno-fetishists. Just wipe them out, will you?
I care because he is a known quantity - not the man so much as the political context he inhabits.
Kimball rose to prominence as the "Hero of the Mojave" when he led a campaign of reprisals against tribals who dared to attack NCR citizens.
Ordering the occupation of Hoover Dam was his first act of office. As water and electricity flowed to NCR cities, his popularity soared.
Conversely, his failure to annex the Mojave these seven years, and the immense costs of occupying a foreign land, have eroded his popular support.
{Oh, the burdens of intelligence} Kimball's entire political career is inextricably bound up with the NCR's occupation of the Mojave. It's his war.
If I compell the NCR to retreat, Kimball will be the sacrifice offered to the gods, so decent NCR citizens can get on with their lives.
In retrospect, the Mojave and Hoover Dam will seem like one man's misadventure. Kimball will be blamed, not me. Not New Vegas.
Then the Hero of the Mojave would become the Martyr of Hoover Dam. And when, subsequently, I force the NCR to retreat...
They lick their wounds, and dream of righteous vengeance against New Vegas. Hello, embargo, farewell, tourist economy.
I've calculated and re-calculated these probabilities. Kimball must live.
{amusing yourself} Imagine two snarling dogs fighting over a curve of bone, perhaps the rib of their master, long-dead.
It'll be a pitched battle, that's a certainty. Perhaps the greatest battle the Earth has seen since the human race nearly made itself extinct.
With Caesar dead, it's hard to know what to expect. The Legate, Lanius, is renowned as a brutal man, not a subtle tactician.
Frontal assaults, wave attacks - these are the sort of tactics one would expect from such a man.
The Legion will mount a ferocious and determined frontal assault from the east, that much is certain.
Still, Caesar is a capable strategist. I'd be surprised if he hasn't found some way to infiltrate the dam, or the NCR's rear areas.
General Oliver's {disparaging} strategy - or "tunnel vision," as I like to call it - has been to mass troops at Hoover Dam.
He wants to out-fight the Legion in a straight-forward slugging match, and then, when they rout, pursue and destroy them in detail.
A crushing, decisive victory of this sort would overshadow the tactical ingenuity of Chief Hanlon's defense four years ago, you see.
A good deal should be obvious to you by now. I won't spoil the rest by talking out of turn.
Can't put the genie back in the bottle, is that it? Maybe you should've thought of that {emphasis} before you conspired to destroy my property.
{lightening somewhat} That said, I'd know nothing of the Omertas' plot if you'd kept it secret. Perhaps I owe you my gratitude, after all...
The information you've provided will suffice. When the battle for Hoover Dam comes, I'll make sure my Securitrons are waiting for the Omertas.
I suppose you're right... When the Legion assaults Hoover Dam, my Securitrons will be waiting for the Omertas. They won't accomplish much.
Exactly how many civilians did you want to die in that crossfire?
Still, you raise a fair point. My Securitrons can handle this. When the Legion attacks Hoover Dam, I'll be waiting for the Omertas.
{admiring the player's knowledge} You're absolutely right. You must've had run-ins with them. As have I...
From time to time, the NCR has assaulted Brotherhood bunkers. In four of the six incidents I know of, the bunkers self-destructed.
I surmise it's standard practice for the Brotherhood to install a self-destruct system. It's consistent with their {disdain} uncompromising nature.
You might use that against them. Or kill them another way, it's up to you. Return when it's done.
I can't use you. Had you shown moderation in your dealings with the NCR, we'd be in a different position.
Oh no, not so quick. I still have work for you.
Don't attack unless there are clear signs that Kimball's visit is imminent. Cause enough chaos to cancel the visit, no more. Then return to me.
Not so eager to take on a suicide mission, is that it? If you'd shown moderation in your dealings with the NCR, we wouldn't be in this position.
Whatever those reasons may be, you've jeopardized the success of this entire concern.
[SUCCEEDED] They knew you were coming? They were better prepared than I anticipated, then. I won't underestimate them again.
Before that happens, I'd ask you to complete one final task. It may seem trivial, but that's far from the case.
[FAILED] Whatever your reasons, you've jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
You could've succeeded!
With this accomplished, all preparations will have been made. The battle for Hoover Dam will be upon us before long.
The strain of defending Las Vegas from annhilation exceeded my power systems' capacity. My primary reactor shut down.
For years, I played a miser with my emergency power supply. I began to run out of reserves around the time I woke the first batch of Securitrons.
Negotiating an allotment of power from Hoover Dam was crucial. That's what's powered the Strip for the past seven years.
Come back when your work at the substation is done.
I needed the operating software on the Platinum Chip to bring it back online.
And to start the reactor itself requires a tremendous jolt of current. Very attention-getting.
The NCR has its hands full now, of course. I doubt they'll raise much of a fuss.
This is not a good time to be dependent on energy from Hoover Dam. When the Legion attacks, the NCR may cut power altogether.
And I'll be needing a good deal more power than the NCR has allotted to the Strip.
Broadcasting encrypted VMQ-boosted command signals to hundreds of Securitrons eats up more power than you might expect.
Indeed they do - an army that'll be too distracted with killing Legionaries to notice the real reason you're there.
Your objective is to reach a control room halfway across the dam and install an override module similar to the one you used at the Substation.
The override will enable to control the entire dam's power output.
You may remember how the bunker at the Fort was rather dimly lit? Well, just like the Lucky 38, it needs a big jolt of electricity to power up.
You've already uploaded the new operating system to the Securitrons. All they need is power and they'll be in fighting trim.
As I've said, your objective is to install an override module in the control room halfway across the dam. Are you ready perform this task?
Indeed you will. Just bear in mind that's not the reason you're there.
No cause for alarm - you'll have an escort of Securitrons to help you fight your way onto the dam.
Since 2278, I've lost five roaming Securitrons near Hidden Valley.
I didn't receive any clear video of the incidents, but telemetry from the units destroyed indicates they were attacked with energy weapons.
It's obvious that the Brotherhood has a base in Hidden Valley or thereabouts. Finding it won't be easy, but getting inside will be the real trick.
We're talking about a {COAT-ah-ree} coterie of bulging-eyed fanatics who think all Pre-War technology belongs to them.
They'll never accept my using an army of robots to defend New Vegas. While it's a fight I can win, I'd rather sidestep it altogether.
Don't tell me that you've fallen for the stories of noble paladins on crusade, preserving mankind's technology in a benighted age? Dross!
{not unkindly} In any case... this is an employer - employee relationship. I've given you an assignment, and the directions are clear.
Simple - an NCR Ranger named Grant is in charge of security arrangements for the visit. Present yourself to him, let him know you want to help.
Given your reputation, it's a near-certainty that he'll accept your offer.
Don't dally. The precise time of Kimball's visit is a closely-guarded secret, but it will happen soon.
There's nothing to think about. You have a job to do, so do it.
{nonplussed} You have?

Yeah yeah, very funny.
Yeah. That's what I thought.
You can't fire me! I'm the boss of this gang! And I say you're fired! And that I'm going back to Rivet City for a drink! Suck on that! {emphasis on "I say YOU'RE fired!"}
Sorry man. I don't know what's gotten into you but you're just a little too intense for me. Maybe come back after you've chilled out and we'll see.
Sorry man. I don't know what's gotten into you but you're just a little too intense for me. Maybe come back after you've chilled out and we'll see.
Nah, I'm good. I only roll with Tunnel Snakes. Come back when you're on your own.
I guess I can let you back into the gang. Once a Snake, always a Snake, huh? Let's roll!
Yeah, let's hit it!
Oh, come on. What? {Annoyed by the delay}
Yeah, well the Snakes don't need you, anyway! We don't need nothing but liquor and guns! Yeah! {Angry and hurt, trying to hide disappointment}
That chamber? Right there? With all the radiation? Man, no way. I'll end up dead. Or worse. I could be one of them Ghouls! Ain't gonna happen.
Oh, like you know better? What?
I can stab, I can shoot, I can do lots of things. What's your pleasure? {Cocky bravado}
Do all the talking you want. Just don't expect me to, you know, listen or anything.
Let's rumble! Yeah!
Up close and personal, that's how I like it!
Yeah, because that's how Snakes fight! Right up in your face, with fangs and... knives and stuff!
You'd better believe it! I should have gotten my hands on some of these earlier!
Sure, I guess. Just don't get in my way, is all I'm saying. {As if saying, "Hey, I don't wanna shoot you, but y'never know what's going to happen, right?"}
If you wanna get closer to me, that's all you gotta say, girl. {Sleazy}
You mean how close you're following me, right? Sure, what's up?
Oh, I'm the best, baby.
Good? Screw that noise - I'm downright awesome!
So... Near? Far? Come on, make up your mind! {frustrated and a little confused}
There better be some action soon, or I'm heading back to the bar.
About time, too!
I get any farther, I might as well be back in the bar. And that's sounding like a better idea all the time, trust me.
What, don't you like my aftershave?
Yeah, got it. Flanking and tactics and stuff. Right. {Doesn't quite get it.}
About time. Seriously.
If this means more stuff for Butch, I'm all for it.
Fine, but what am I supposed to do here? Work on my needlepoint or something?
Well, if it isn't "my hero," the guy who sprang me from the Vault! I think I owe this man a drink!
Well, if it isn't my best gal, the one who sprung me from the Vault! I think I owe this lovely lady a drink!
How's it hanging?
Hey, what's the word?
It's a shame you've got to go. But you'll do okay out there, I'm sure. {Firm}
Hey, if it ain't a fellow Tunnel Snake, slumming it down here with the old crew?
I thought you'd be out there tearing up the Wasteland and raising Hell!
But if you've gotta be back, might as well make yourself useful. You gotta help us.
Damn, look who's come waltzing back into the Vault?
It takes some real balls coming back here after everything you and your dad screwed up.
But if you've gotta be back, might as well make yourself useful. You gotta help us.
Hey, what's the word?
Think you can take charge of the gang by getting rid of me?
Hey, man. Can I come with you again? This place sucks.
About time you got back. I got a full clip and an empty flask. Time we fixed that, huh?
What's up?
What's the story, my fellow Tunnel Snake?
You got something to say to the Butch-man?
Hell yeah, I do! I could be out there and kicking butt in my own gang and everything. The Tunnel Snakes could ride again!
Or, y'know, slither again. Whatever!
What? A goody-two-shoes like you could never make it in a real gang! {Dismissive "pfft" before start}
You want to hang with a Tunnel Snake like me, you gotta be hard. {Emphasis: HARD.}
Whoa, hey, that's cool and all, but you're just a little too... intense, y'know?
I mean, Butch is down for action, but you... You're a psycho!
I really wish I could, man, but three's a crowd, you know? I'll just stay here for now.
Tunnel Snakes rule!
Yeah... yeah! You'd be perfect for my gang! You're in!
Tunnel Snakes rule!
Yeah, well what do you know? I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna have the biggest, toughest gang ever!
Y'know... tomorrow. Once I round up a few more people... {Cowardly, trying to hide the fact that he won't do it.}
Sure, fine, whatever.
I'm gonna barber the hell outta that hair! {Trying to make it sound cool.}
Okay, hold still.
The damned G.O.A.T. said I'm supposed to be a hairdresser, but that ain't me! {disdain on "hairdresser" - it's not cool enough for him}
I'm a barber, you got that? There's a difference! {emphasis on "barber" - it's a big difference to him.}
Sure, fine, whatever.
I'm gonna barber the hell outta your hair! {Trying to make it sound cool.}
Okay, hold still.
I'll start a gang, of course! Why, it'll be the toughest, coolest, badass-est gang the Wasteland's ever seen!
Hey, play your cards right, maybe I'll even let you join it, huh? {Assumes the player would obvious want to do so, because obviously, it'll be an awesome gang.}
Yeah, but I'm thinking it'll be a new gang. We ain't going to just be in tunnels, you know!
Besides, there's gonna be a lot more people who want to join. Competition's gonna be tough!
'Cause maybe you've got an ounce of sense. Everyone's gonna want to join, once they know Butch is in town!
Well, they ain't seen nothing like me, yet. Butch is gonna take that Wasteland by storm!
Yeah, well get us out of here, and we'll see, won't we?
Because you've always been a goody two-shoes, so when I need help, it's what you're gonna do, right?
You're going to help Amata anyway, right? Just make it so we can leave the Vault, and I'll leave and never bother you again.
Look, I know I've been kind of a jerk. But I don't deserve to be stuck down here forever. Not when I could have a real life up there like you.
I mean, you're kind of a jerk sometimes, and you make it work up there. So why not me?
Just make it so we can leave the Vault, and I can go out there for my new life. Heck, maybe we could form a gang, huh?
You left this place, so I bet you hate it as much as I do. So you can imagine how crappy it'd be to be stuck down here forever, yeah?
Are you gonna force all of us to live like that, now that we've learned we could actually leave and try for something new?
Just make it so we can get out of this vault, and I'll be gone, man. Then you don't ever need to see me again, okay?
Really? Score!
Goodbye, hellhole! I'm off to a new life!
Are you kidding me? It's a dream come true, man! Butch the Hairdresser is no more, now I'm gonna be Butch the Wasteland Wanderer!
Maybe I can form a gang of my own. Maybe call it the Wasteland Radicals, or maybe the Rad Scorpions. Hey, wanna join?
Yeah, well, I can learn, can't I? If you can do it, it's gotta be pretty easy.
Maybe I can form a gang of my own. Maybe call it the Wasteland Radicals, or maybe the Rad Scorpions. Hey, wanna join?
What sort of help do you think I mean? You must have heard about the changes since you left, right?
The deaths, the lies, the whole Overseer lockdown thing? Ringing any bells?
Man, they'd have rushed in here long ago if they didn't know I stole one of their guns from when they issued martial law! {Proud he can inspire that sort of fear}
Anyway, you gotta help us get out of here. You gotta help me get out of here. {Emphasis on "gotta help ME get out of here" He's totally self-centered.}
Because you're a goody two-shoes, right? You get off on helping people in trouble? Isn't that why you saved my mom?
I bet she'd thank you herself, but she and I ain't exactly on speaking terms at the moment. At least, not when she's sober. {Pretty callous about his mom.}
But I tell you, your old man had the right idea. I can't stand it down here anymore. You gotta help me get out.
You shut up! Just shut up and listen, okay? {The player hit a nerve - his mom died last time he asked the player for help.}
Listen, you're about the only person who ever had the sense to get out of this place. {half angry, half pleading}
I tell you, your old man had the right idea. I can't stand it down here anymore. You gotta help me get out.
Man, screw the entire Vault, what about me?
Even these rebels just want the option to go outside for lousy trading and stuff. I just want to get the hell out of here for good.
Why stay here and be stuck as a barber for my entire life when I could go out there and make my own choices?
Because anything up there has got to be better than a lifetime of the same thing down here.
Think about it, man. Down here, I'll always be stuck with the same job, with the same food, with the same people, forever.
You and your dad had the right idea: get out of this pit and make your own life.
I heard old Stanley complaining a lot of the stuff down in the reactor got fried pretty bad.
Nothing too bad... yet. But he's always worrying we'll lose air filtration or whatever.
Of course, if that happened... guess we'd all have to leave the vault then, huh? {Impishly pleased with the idea.}
Here's to raising hell and living the good life out here! Cheers!
Now all we need is a gang, and we could take over this whole Wasteland!
Ah, you know you can't keep a Tunnel Snake cooped up forever! We gotta be free, and your little visit was just the inspiration I needed!
So here's to sweet, glorious freedom! Cheers!
Same way anyone does. By being too cool to stop anywhere else! I didn't see a thing in the wasteland that was a match for a bona fide Tunnel Snake! {full of ridiculous bravado}
So, here's to freedom and rocking the Wasteland! Drink up!
No such luck, sucker! Life ain't worth living without Butch around, and you can't keep a Tunnel Snake down. {a bit drunk}
But if you're lucky, you can hold my empties. Here. {a bit drunk}

Don't think because I'm a Ghoul, I'm stupid. You're fine.
Is this a trick question? I don't even see a scratch on you.
Injured... ha! This is just a nick. If you can't tough it out and you want to be fixed up it'll cost you 50 caps.
I'd hesitate to even call this a wound, but if you insist. 50 caps should cover my expenses.
Yeah, you could do with some work. It'll set you back 75 caps, but well worth it.
This is pretty bad, but I've seen worse. Still, it's going to cost 75 caps to get you back on your feet.
Yeah, you look almost as bad as I do. Of course, I'm supposed to look this way and you aren't. 100 caps will do it for my expenses.
Did you get the number of that Brahmin that trampled you? Sheesh! If you want me to stitch you back together, it'll be 100 caps.
I don't see anything wrong with you.
Alright, that should do it. You need anything else?
And we're all done. That wasn't so bad, was it? Did you need anything else?

Okay.
Oh, don't get me started on them. I'm liable to talk about them all day! It even drives poor old Bob crazy.
They wouldn't listen to me at all! If I told them something simple, then it got done. Otherwise, Birch spent a week looking for a hidden meaning.
Plus, he used to just pop in whenever he wanted and started chanting this nonsense.
Sometimes I used to just sit there silently just to make him mad! That was fun for a while.
Hopefully this will all change now that things are different... thanks to you!

Plus, he just pops in whenever he wants and starts chanting this nonsense.
Sometimes I just sit there silently just to make him mad. That was fun for a while, but even that's getting boring now.
Oh, you wouldn't believe how they handle them. They make them drink this gunk that Poplar makes.
Sometimes they just go nuts and start running around, and sometimes when they wake up and see me they run for the hills!
I'll tell you, Outsiders are almost as entertaining as the Treeminders!
Actually, the kid is the nicest one of all. Yew's her name. She sneaks in here sometimes and just lets me talk about stuff I wanna talk about.
Bob really likes her too, cause she makes me happy.
Okay, okay. Let me talk real careful for the slow folks.
I was once a man a long time ago named Harold. Something in me changed and a weird little tree started growing right out of my head.
It kept getting bigger until I ended up stuck inside. When people would ask about it, I decided to name it Bob. You know, like a friend or something.
Sometimes I call him Herbert instead of Bob, because I get bored and I think it's funny. So long story short, call me Harold!
Lemme guess... you said something dumb and now Birch wants you outta Oasis. Wonderful.
You better get a move on before they really get mad and hunt you down.
Oh great. Now you got yourself kicked out of here.
Looks like I'll have to find someone else to help me. You better get outta here... these guys will get pretty cross if you stick around.
I can't believe you'd kill those innocent people like that. And I thought I was a monster!
If I could move, I would show you a thing or two, but Bob has me stuck here.
Those people you killed were some of the most peaceful people in the Wasteland!
How could you do that to them?
Leave me alone! Me and Bob have better things to do than speak to a murderer!
Now go away and never come back!
How dare you come into Oasis and shoot up the place!
Even Bob is mad at you, and he never gets mad except when I don't stop calling him Herbert!
So, it looks like you decided to do things their way. How come?
See Herbert? Now that's a nice person for you. Why can't you be more like that!
Look, Herbert, he's back. I told you!
Look, Herbert, she's back. I told you!
Glad to see you're finally awake. I can't believe they made you do that stupid ceremony.
They listen when I talk, but they don't hear... know what I mean?
Should we give them another chance, Herbert?
Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
No, I suppose you aren't. My mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
What do you say Herbert, should I give them another chance?
Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
I can't say I blame you. Its my mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
What do you say Herbert, should I give them another chance?

Now don't get crazy on me and start wearing branches...
Come back and visit me some time.
Okay! Wave bye-bye Bob! Oh come one, move a branch at least... sigh.
<Sigh> I wish I was too. Then me and Herbert could be the best of friends and live side by side.
He's the tree, you see. We're old pals... the best of buddies and we know each other inside and out; literally.
Well, his name's really Bob. I think it's funny to call him Herbert. But I don't think he thinks it's that funny.
Neither have I. Well, I mean I talk to Herbert, but he never really says anything back.
He kept growing around me, maybe for calling him Herbert all the time. His name's really Bob. I think it's funny when I call him Herbert though.
Where? You mean in here? Nah, it's just me and Herbert. He's the tree.
We're old pals... the best of buddies and we know each other inside and out; literally.
Well, his name's really Bob. I think it's funny to call him Herbert. But I don't think he thinks it's that funny.
I know they mean well... and for awhile it was nice to be needed. But I'm not sure I want to be a giant tree anymore.
Well, truth be told it's Herbert that's the tree. He sorta just took over, you know? Probably to get back at me for calling him Herbert all the time.
His name's really Bob. I think it's funny when I call him Herbert though.
Well, I suppose you could look at it that way. See, Bob used to ride around on top of my head, sunk his roots right in there, ya know?
Well, eventually he got bigger than me, and then I pretty much ended up inside.
Well, you're quite clever.
See, Bob used to ride around on top of my head, sunk his roots right in there, ya know?
Well, eventually he got bigger than me, and then I pretty much ended up inside.
Not very bright, are you?
Bob, that's the tree, used to ride around on top of my head, sunk his roots right in there, ya know?
Well, eventually he got bigger than me, and then I pretty much ended up inside.
It was a long time ago... I tend to lose track.
I was exploring some sort of a military base with some other people... I think it was called Mariposa.
We were pretty deep inside and we found some weird vats of this nasty green goo. Right when we were about to leave, I think we were attacked.
Last thing I remember before blacking out was something knocking my friend into the stuff.
Whoa-ho! Check out the brain on this guy!

Yes, perhaps it doesn't even matter anyway. Forget I mentioned it.
You have no idea how glad I am to hear that. Or, we're glad to hear that... me and Bob.
I had you brought in here to ask a very simple favor.
Would you please kill me?
Yes, yes I do. Or I guess WE do... me and Bob that is.
I had you brought in here to ask a very simple favor.
Would you please kill me?
Yes, you're right of course, I completely agree. Or I guess WE completely agree... me and Bob that is.
I had you brought in here to ask a very simple favor.
Would you please kill me?
So, they really need me that badly, huh? I guess I never thought of it that way. Awfully selfish of me.
Should we give them another chance, Herbert?
Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
No, I suppose you aren't. My mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.

Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
No, no. Herbert is the tree... Bob is his real name, but I call him Herbert cause I think it's pretty funny.
But I'm still in here too, what's left of me. The name's Harold.
No, no. Herbert is the tree... Bob is his real name, but I call him Herbert cause I think it's pretty funny.
But I'm still in here too, what's left of me. The name's Harold.
No, no. Herbert is the tree... Bob is his real name, but I call him Herbert cause I think it's pretty funny.
But I'm still in here too, what's left of me. The name's Harold.
Oh no, no, no. It wouldn't be murder. You'd be doing me a favor.
You see, I've been stuck here for over two decades now... rooted right into the ground.
The only friends I've got are Bob and those weirdos out there who think I'm a god.
Completely serious. You'd be doing me a favor.
You see, I've been stuck here for over two decades now... rooted right into the ground.
The only friends I've got are Bob and those weirdos out there who think I'm a god.
I wish it was that simple. No, no. There's only one way you're going to be able to do this for me.
How to put this? ...I've been feeling rather "spread out" lately. I think Bob's kinda shoved my insides around some.
It's hard to tell where everything is, but it's always that way with one's insides, isn't it?
Anyway, I believe Bob's carried some of my organs into his root system. I want you to go underground and destroy my heart.
Oh no, don't worry about them. When you decide to go down there, I'll have a little chat with Birch and the rest of the gang.
They usually don't understand a word I say, but I'll make them come around.
Now how exactly am I supposed to do that? I can barely move anymore.
Thanks to Bob, I'm obviously not going to be doing anything for a very long time.
You will? Oh! You've made us so happy! Isn't that right Bob?
Just give me a little time to say goodbye to good old Bob and then I'll be ready.
Of all the Wastelanders I had to bump into it has to be one with a conscience. {To self annoyed}
Let's keep it an open invitation then. I don't want to wait until the next person visits, it could be years.
Just think about it, okay?
Of course. I know this is an unusual request, but hey, I'm an unusual tree. Well, Bob is anyway...
We'll just keep it an open invitation then. I don't want to wait until the next person visits, it could be years... you're all I've got.
Well, I used to carry those pesky caps a long time ago, but I think my pockets are in those shrubs over yonder.
I'm pretty sure the caves below me are full of all kinds of nifty gizmos you could take on your way to my heart. Help yourself!
Oh, no no no no! Fire would be too painful for me and poor old Bob. Keep that stuff away from us!
The heart would be just fine... I won't feel a thing.
Leave it to good old Bob to get me stuck above some caves. Now my dang feet are cold!
I think the best way for you to get down there would be to get the key from the one those loonies call "Cypress."
There's supposed to be some old gate or something back in the other grove.
Sometimes I feel stuff tickling me, but I think that's just Bob getting back at me for all the times I called him Herbert.
I've been literally rooted to this spot thanks to Bob for maybe twenty or thirty years... I can't even remember anymore.
Can you imagine being stuck in one place for that long not being able to eat or to read or to sleep or anything?
In the meantime, I have these Treeminders bothering me every day about things I don't even care about. I can't stand it anymore.
I've tried to stay happy, really I have. Bloomseer Poplar thinks I'll live for hundreds of years... maybe even more!
Can you imagine THAT? Stuck here for centuries? I can't do it, I just want to be alone. Just me and Bob until the end.
When I saw you coming towards Oasis, I thought I felt that you'd understand me. I guess I was wrong.
I knew you would. That's why I picked you when I saw you coming.
Hey, I thought that too... at first.
I had them sing me songs, I made them do stupid dances and things like that. Bob even told me to make Maple stand on his head for a whole day!
After a while though, it just gets boring. Then it becomes a nuisance and now it's completely driving me nuts!
When I saw you coming towards Oasis, I thought I felt that you'd understand me. I guess I was wrong.
Maybe I'm just losing my mind from all this boredom, but I swear if I try I can see all around me like my eyes are in every leaf on every tree.
I think it's making Bob kind of jealous, cause he was the first tree in my life and all that.
I'm telling you, it is possible, or maybe I'm just losing my mind from all this boredom.
I swear if I try real hard, I can see all around me like my eyes are in every leaf on every tree.
I think it's making Bob kind of jealous, cause he was the first tree in my life and all that.
You have a point there. Maybe I'm just losing my marbles from all this boredom.
I swear if I try real hard, I can see all around me like my eyes are in every leaf on every tree.
I think it's making Bob kind of jealous, cause he was the first tree in my life and all that.
Don't worry, Herbert, he'll be back. Ha! I love that one... gets me every time.
Don't worry, Herbert, she'll be back. Ha! I love that one... gets me every time.
See you later... well, maybe not if you do what I've asked.
Oh okay... I guess me and Bob will see you again soon.
It's kind of embarrassing really. Once a year, Bob decides he's going to go ahead and start growing these weird pods filled with tiny seeds.
Well, all it takes is a good wind and the seeds just fly everywhere.
I call them Herbert's Seeds. He hates that!
Okay.

Hold on Jonas, I need to record this first. {muted - away from mike}
I don't really know how to tell you this. I hope you'll understand, but I know you might be angry. {pause at the beginning, like he's trying to think of what to say}
I thought about it for a long time, but in the end I decided it was best for you not to know.
So many things could have gone wrong, and there's really no telling how the Overseer will react when he finds out.
It's best if he can blame everything on me.
Obviously, you already know that I'm gone. It was something I needed to do. You're an adult now. You're ready to be on your own.
Maybe some day, things will change and we can see each other again. I can't tell you why I left or where I'm going. I don't want you to follow me.
God knows life in the Vault isn't perfect, but at least you'll be safe. Just knowing that will be enough to keep me going.
Don't mean to rush you, Doc, but I'd feel better if we got this over with. {This should be in Jonas's voice will require script trickery to make it show up in Jonas's script. Muted away from mike.}
Okay. Go ahead. {muted away from mike}
Goodbye. I love you. {sound of vault door opening in the background}
Was that really necessary?
I certainly didn't raise you to behave like that.
That was uncalled for.
Be more careful, will you?
What are you doing? That's dangerous!
Stop that! Someone could get hurt.
Watch where you point that.
That's not a toy, you know.
Now's not really the time for that, is it?
Getting some exercise, are we?
Please be careful.
A bit clumsy today, are we?
Watch where you're going.
Be careful with that.
I trust you know what you're doing.
Would you stop screwing around?
Watch it, will you?
Take cover!
Look out!
Do you know where that's been?
Is that really necessary?

I'm glad to hear it. Once you start letting bullies push you around, you'll never see the end of it.
Come on now, I bet there's someone else out there with a present for you!
I wish we didn't have to invite him, but there just aren't that many children your age in the Vault.
In any case, you'll have to learn to deal with bullies. The world is full of people much worse than Butch, I'm afraid.
But don't let him ruin your birthday. Go on, I bet there's someone else waiting to give you a present!
Please don't do that. I know you don't like Butch, but if you start picking fights with him, how are you any better?
Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself, but don't go looking for trouble. There's trouble enough in this world without adding to it.
Well, now, that's more than enough lecturing for a birthday party! Go on and enjoy yourself.
We sure can't, unless we want the Overseer beating down our door. Jonas and I have found a place, though. C'mon!
Easy now. It's only a BB gun, but it's not a toy. Let's go try it out. Jonas and I have found a nice spot for you. Follow me.
Out already? Something wrong with the sights on that thing? Here you go, honey.
Out already? Something wrong with the sights on that thing? Here you go, son.
Okay, then. You're doing fine. Just aim and shoot. I think you'll be a natural.
Nasty little things. They pretty much keep to dark places, though. That's why there are always lights on in the Vault.
I'd try using that new gun of yours!
They're pretty easy to kill. More a nuisance than anything else.
Of course, you could just aim for the head. A good headshot will do a lot of damage to most anything.
I know you can, and that's good. I'm not always going to be here to take care of you. You've got to learn to fend for yourself.
Now, take your time, breathe slowly, sight down the barrel, and squeeze the trigger.
Of course you can. I'm not always going to be here to take care of you. You're going to have to learn to fend for yourself.
Now, take your time, breathe slowly, sight down the barrel, and squeeze the trigger.
The Overseer gave you your Pip-Boy, and you're old enough to do some work. So I figure you’re old enough for this. {;serious tone, leading up to the surprise of getting the BB gun}
Your own BB gun! It's a little old, but it should work perfectly.
Jonas found it down here. It was in pretty rough shape took us a good three months to find the parts to get it working again.
You know how tough it is to find a spring that small? Good thing Butch "misplaced" that switchblade of his. Ha ha ha! {;probably more excited about giving this gift than the child is about receiving itwhich is to say, pretty damn excited}
So, what do you think? Want to give it a try?
Since when? Regardless, I think you'll like this one. You're getting older, and you've got your Pip-Boy. I figure you're old enough for this, too. {;serious tone, leading up to the surprise of getting the BB gun}

Couldn't have done it without Jonas' help. You make sure to thank him.
You're welcome, pal. Happy birthday.
You're welcome, sweetie. Happy birthday.
I'm sorry you feel that way. Maybe you haven't grown up as much as I'd thought. If you don't want it, I'm sure I can find someone who does.

Hold on Jonas, I need to record this first. {muted - away from mike}
I don't really know how to tell you this. I hope you'll understand, but I know you might be angry. {pause at the beginning, like he's trying to think of what to say}
I thought about it for a long time, but in the end I decided it was best for you not to know.
So many things could have gone wrong, and there's really no telling how the Overseer will react when he finds out.
It's best if he can blame everything on me.
Obviously, you already know that I'm gone. It was something I needed to do. You're an adult now. You're ready to be on your own.
Maybe some day, things will change and we can see each other again. I can't tell you why I left or where I'm going. I don't want you to follow me.
God knows life in the Vault isn't perfect, but at least you'll be safe. Just knowing that will be enough to keep me going.
Don't mean to rush you, Doc, but I'd feel better if we got this over with. {This should be in Jonas's voice will require script trickery to make it show up in Jonas's script. Muted away from mike.}
Okay. Go ahead. {muted away from mike}
Goodbye. I love you. {sound of vault door opening in the background}
Good work! That's one less Radroach to deal with.
Let's get a picture together. Capture the moment.
Having trouble with that Radroach?
Something wrong? That Radroach is still over there.
Well, what do you think? You can come down here and shoot any time you want.
Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. Here are some more BBs.
If you're having trouble, try crouching to steady your aim.
Go ahead. Try out your new gun on those targets over there.
Come on. We'll show you the place.
Are you ready for your surprise?
Hey, that was Jonas on the intercom. He and I have been cooking up a little surprise present.
Jonas is waiting for you downstairs on the Reactor Level. Go ahead, I don't think anyone will mind if you slip out for a few minutes.
Just be patient. You don't want to ruin the surprise, do you? Go ahead, Jonas is waiting!
Are you all right? Is Butch giving you a hard time again?
Having a good time? It wasn't easy keeping this a secret! Now go on, I'm sure everyone else would like a chance to talk to the birthday boy.
Having a good time? It wasn't easy keeping this a secret! Now go on, I'm sure everyone else would like a chance to talk to the birthday girl.
Hey there, pal. Having fun?
Hi, honey. Having fun?
I can't believe you're 10 already. Your mother would have been proud of you, son. Now go on and enjoy your party!
I can't believe you're 10 already. Your mother would have been proud of you, honey. Now go on and enjoy your party!
Listen, once you finish being a good host, I have something I want to show you.
Was that really necessary?
I certainly didn't raise you to behave like that.
That was uncalled for.
Be more careful, will you?
What are you doing? That's dangerous!
Stop that! Someone could get hurt.
Watch where you point that.
That's not a toy, you know.
Now's not really the time for that, is it?
Getting some exercise, are we?
Please be careful.
A bit clumsy today, are we?
Watch where you're going.
Be careful with that.
I trust you know what you're doing.
Would you stop screwing around?
Watch it, will you?
Take cover!
Look out!
Do you know where that's been?
Is that really necessary?

Hey, it's not my call. Those are the rules.
You're sixteen now, so this year you take the G.O.A.T.
Come on. It's not so bad. Everyone has to take it. You'll do just fine.
No, you're not. Really.
When I started studying medicine, one of the first things I learned was how to spot a kid playing sick to get out of taking a test.
You'll do fine. It's not so bad. Everyone has to take it when they're sixteen. I had to, you have to, and so does everyone else.
And most everyone makes it through without a scratch. {;ironicallyit's just a standardized test}
The Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test. G.O.A.T.! Everyone here in the Vault takes it when they're sixteen.
Helps to figure out what sort of job you'll have here in Vault 101 when you get a bit older. So, pay attention and try not to fall asleep.
You know what the Overseer says: "We're born in the Vault. We die in the Vault."
"Each is tested to determine their abilities, that they may work for the betterment of all Vault residents." Sound familiar?
That's not the way it works. And it won't do to go around asking questions like that. Especially not around the Overseer.
I want to tell you something now. It's important, so listen closely: this place, this Vault... it's not perfect, I know. But it is your home.
You're safe here. Stay on the Overseer's good side, and you always will be. You understand? You need to appreciate all you have.
Because what's up there, on the outside, that's not the life I want for you, and it's not what your mother wanted for you, either.
That's what the Overseer says, isn't it?
He's not about to let anyone else in, so I guess that's how it'll have to be.
You're here now, and it's a hell of a lot better than being up there. All your mother and I ever wanted was for you to be safe, and you're safe here.
Your mother, she... she was beautiful. But... beyond the beauty you've seen. There's just so much those old photos can never show.
And she was passionate. About life, about love. But most of all, most of all she was passionate about you.
When she became pregnant, it was the happiest I had ever seen her. Ahhhh.... she had great things in mind for you....
And so! Time for you to stop stalling and get to class! Please, honey, please take these achievement tests seriously.
The last thing I need is you mother's ghost haunting me because her only child became a garbage burner.

Go on, now. You've got a G.O.A.T. to take.
Come on, pal. You're fine, and you know it.
You're a perfectly healthy 16-year-old boy.
So, you need to get to class and take your G.O.A.T. exam. No excuses.
