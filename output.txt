You see Abel.
You see a large mutant.
You are not supposed to be here.
Hng.
Of course not. I'm here to kill you!
Why do you say that?
Oh, yeah? Your momma!
Pik!
I'm gonna kick yer ass if you say that again!
Pik! Pik!
Oh, you gonna get it now!
You human. Me mutant. Mutant kill human.
How can you do that? What about the force field?
Abel take care of that. Then Abel kick yer ass!
Children are not allowed here. This mutant place. Go away.
Hng!
I have to get through this force field. Please lower it.
No.
You again. Abel kick yer ass!
 tell me about name
Me Abel.
 tell me about generic
Hng.
Why do you say that?
You see an inhabitant of Adytown.
Looks like rain . . . as always.
Sorry, have to go. Got work to do.
We don't get many outsiders here.
Gotta get back to work.
I'd get back to the Hub, if I were you.
Good day . . . if that is what you can call it.
Yeah . . . whatever.
No time to talk.
Can't talk right now.
Hope the rain ain't glowin' like yesterday.
Looks like we're going to be short food again.
I hope the caravans pass by again soon.
We have a chance to make it now.
Adytum will be the town we want it to be.
Thank you for your help.
Thank you for getting rid of the Regulators.
Thank you for our freedom.
It is good that the Regulators are gone.
Welcome to the New Adytum.
You see a super mutant. He is guarding the airlock door.
You see a super mutant guard.
Jeremiah, you may pass.
Move along.
Move faster, messenger.
Normals cannot carry weapons here! Halt and identify yourself!
Grrr!
Uh, sorry. I'll put it away.
I'm just passing through. No need for identities here.
Die! Die! Die! I always wanted to say that.
I will not be spoken to that way. You will be punished.
Halt! What is your business here, 'child'.
Hng!
I'm, uh, doing stuff.
I'm on important business. You have no right to stop and question me.
Don't talk to me, big boy.
Your answer does not settle my nerves. Speak quickly and clearly, or I will assume you are here for foul purposes. I assure you that you will not like that...
Uh, no, really, honestly. I'm doing stuff.
I'm bringing a message to our leader.
I sense the untruth behind your words. You will not be allowed in. This I promise you...
You may pass, but next time, follow the proper procedure...
Ok, thanks. See you around.
And what's that?
Blessing to you, brother.
A true follower of the Master would have that knowledge. You are an intruder!
Move along. I don't have time for your questions.
You are annoying me.
I have work to do. Do you?
You are making a mistake by coming here. Explain yourself or perish...
Nuggie!
I have nothing to say.
I'm here to protect humanity from the likes of you.
Oh, shut up!
You should not try to fool me by playing dumb. I tire of this...
What kind of foolish bigotry is that, we are 'humanity.' We're just as human as you are.
What kind of crap is that?
There is no possible way that you are human.
My name is Kyle. I was born to a mother and a father, like yourself. The Master just oversaw my rebirth. These muscles, this skin, this strength does not make me any less human than you. I do not like all that the Unity stands for, but it is the best chance for peace that we have.
Not on my watch, it isn't. I'm here to put an end to you and your kind.
You may be human, but that still doesn't make your Unity right. I guess we will be enemies.
It is a pity that you act this way, but you will not proceed further...
It will be a true shame to see your head on a pike.
Intruders!
I no speak to you.
You gain 
 experience points for bluffing your way past the guards.
You see Mitch of the All-N-One store.
How may I help you today?
aI'd like to buy something.
bI'd like to sell something.
cNothing. Thanks.
dRunk.
Great. Here's what I have.
Great, always looking for new things.
Sorry, I can't understand you. Come back when you get more of a brain.
Thanks. Come again.
You see Jake the Arms Dealer.
You see Alya, a desert raider.
I am Alya of the Khans. How might I help you today?
aI'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Have you seen her?
bHow about a little kiss?
cWhy has your band of Raiders attacked Shady Sands?
dNo, thank you.
eHooroo!
If she is one of those women from Shady Sands, maybe you should look there. Now go, I need to finish sharpening my knives. 
aKiss this!
We do not attack those of Shady Sands. We are from the same place they are. It is only right that they share with us!
aBut you are hurting their livestock and terrifying them.
bThat seems fair to me.
cUh, yeah. I think I will be going now.
You sound just as wimpy as they are. Look, if they were in any trouble of starvation, then it is their own fault for not planning ahead. Consider what we do a trade in talents.
aA trade in talents?!? How can this be a trade in talents? You don't give them anything.
Sure, and chickens have three legs.
Uh, yeah. I think I will be going now.
I am sorry, but I can't understand you. I'm sharpening my knives and would not like to be bothered.
We give them the most important thing possible. We give their dreary lives excitement.
I don't think they want your type of excitement.
I think I will make their lives boring again. I'll start with you!
Uh, yeah. I think I will be going now.
I didn't ask. But since you obviously don't have any concept of fun, I think I will end your existence.
Mocking me does not bode well for you. I suggest you leave my presence.
Darn straight that it's fair. Now get out of my face.
I am busy right now preparing for our next raid.
You see Andrew, the jail guard.
Okay, you can go now.
Hey! You! Stop!
Can I help you?
Who are you?
What are you doing?
cNo thanks.
I'm Andrew. My job is to guard the jail.
I'm guarding the jail. I make sure that miscreants don't get in or out.
Why would you keep people from getting in the jail?
Oh.
You have a good day. And stay out of trouble.
Someone might leave something to help a prisoner escape. Or someone might get locked inside, and stuck until we could get the keys.
Eergh!
Move along, fella.
Move along, miss.
Hey! Knock it off!
You see Aradesh.
Greetings, wanderer. Please do not be offended if the gentlefolk about seem rude. As Dharma said, 'Tough times tan the human hide.' Your business in Shady Sands might be?
Greetings. Your business in Shady Sands might be?
bWe don't take to strangers much. Your business in Shady Sands?
I'm from a small village west of here. I'm just exploring and mean you no harm.
What's it to you?
My reasons are mine to keep.
I'm from a Vault to the west. My people are dying of thirst and I need to find a water purifier chip for them to survive.
I'm saving an entire people from destruction!
Shady Sands? Whoops, I'm lost! I'll just be going now.
Hunh?
I know of no village to the west.
Have you been through the mountains west of here?
So?
Are you saying you know every location from here to the ocean?
I'm sure you've been many places, but you must have missed my tiny village.
Ah well, to my regret, I have not. Which begs the question, how did you make that passage?
It was pretty tough, but I made it.
What's it to you?
Look, all I wanted was a few supplies and things, but I will gladly go elsewhere.
I don't need to answer you.
Yes, hmmm, yes, yes. yes. I shall believe you...for now. But we do not trust easily, especially those who might be dangerous. Know that Seth and I will be watching you.
It is my town, wanderer. You must answer my questions or leave. This is not a matter of choice.
I don't have to tell you anything.
I mean you no harm, really.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
You are quite insolent. I believe you should leave. Do not return. You will not be welcome.
So be it, wanderer. Seth will show you out.
You must think me quite gullible, wanderer. You conquered the mountains by yourself?
Doesn't matter how I think. It's true I came from the mountains.
No, just stupid.
As Dharma said, 'Caution is life in troubled times. Your origin is not the issue. Your intent is.
Okay.
AI will let you pass, but know this: Seth and I will watch you very, very closely. Do not even consider bringing trouble here.
And keep them you may. But this is not a city of open hospitality. If you desire that, go to Junktown. You may enter, but know we have our eyes on you.
A Vault. How shall I trust you, wanderer, when you are not honest with me?
No, honestly, I come from a Vault!
The Vault is . . . the name of my village.
You're right, I was lying.
Hmmm, yes, yes, yes. Then tell me of this Vault.
Well . . . the Vault is actually the name of my town. We name it that because it's in between two big cliffs.
It's a big place built into a mountain far to the west. My people have been there for the last  years.
Why do you want to know?
Wanderer, I shall believe you . . . for now. You may enter Shady Sands, but be warned your every move will be watched.
I will not be lied to, wanderer.
I don't have to tell you anything.
I mean you no harm, really.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Hmmm. You may enter. But stay out of trouble.
What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
What's going on around here?
Thanks. Bye.
Greetings again, young wanderer. I hope your stay here has been pleasant.
It's been great. Can I ask you some questions?
It has. I gotta run though.
If you like sewers.
Nuh-huh.
nGreetings. What may I help you with this fine day?
bIs there something you want?
Can you tell me about Shady Sands?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?
Nothing, really, I was just leaving.
Nuh-uh.
Certainly. What do you wish to know?
bYou may ask, but please hurry. There are more important uses for my time.
What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
What's going on around here?
Thanks. Bye.
gAh. Happy journeys, wanderer.
nGoodbye.
bI certainly hope so.
Dharma said, 'A man and his wayward tongue are soon parted.' Come back when you have learned some manners.
That is quite enough, wanderer. Seth will show you out of the city. Do not return. Your welcome will not be pleasant.
gShady Sands is much like a family, one that keeps to itself.
bWe are a very protective community. As Dharma said, 'Many sticks can be broken. A bundle cannot.'
What kind of things do you have around here?
Interesting. Are there any other cities around here?
How cute. Well, I better be going.
The Gardens are on the south side. The Brahma Pens are north, although the smell is, I fear, quite intense this time of year.
Anything else?
aWe are small and self sufficient so there is little else to tell.
Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?
Thanks. Bye.
bIt is a small place. You have feet.
Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions?
bDharma said, 'Heed not the call of the wolf when the fox is raiding the hen house.'
gJunktown lies south of here, though there is little in the way of visitation. From stories, I'm certain there are cities south of that.
Thanks. I . . . Can I ask you a few more questions?
It is a quiet time, thankfully.
Sounds . . . boring
Well, then, can I ask you a few more questions?
Good. Hopefully it will stay that way for a while.
Yes. We like it that way.
What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
What's going on around here?
Thanks. Bye.
Oh my yes. Great packs of Rad Scorpions are killing our herds. We don't know where they're from, and no matter how many we kill, there's always more!
Go on.
aAnd now the monsters are attacking my people! Razlo is trying to find a cure for their poison, but I'm not sure how it goes.
Well, I'll help you get rid of these things!
I can help you for a price.
That's terrible. Can I ask you a few more questions?
Ummm, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Please talk to Razlo. He possesses far more information on these creatures than I.
As Dharma said, 'Those who tend their own flock, know the shepherd.'
I know it's hard for you to trust, but I would like to help.
Your choice. Can I ask you some more questions?
aPlease hurry and rid us of those Rad Scorpions!
Things are much more settled now. Razlo has been working on a cure for Rad Scorpion poison, and with that, we should be able to fight what's left of them.
It was nothing. Can I ask you some more questions?
You don't need to worry anymore. I destroyed the Nest.
You are truly a hero! Know that the people of Shady
Sands are most grateful.
Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions, though?
Thanks. Bye!
If you can understand me, please try to find my daughter.
Since you brought my Tandi back to me, things are quite fine. My eternal gratitude to you, wanderer.
What can you tell me about the other towns around here?
What's going on around here?
Thanks. Bye.
Yes, yes. Umm. Have a good stay.
Ahh, wanderer. How goes the search for my daughter?
Sorry, but I haven't found her. I will, though.
I'm sorry, but she is dead.
Duh-nada.
Sorry, but I haven't found her. I will, though.
Slow, but I am making some progress. Can I ask you a few more questions?
Guunngggg!
aThank you for trying. Please leave me to my grief.
May my thoughts be wings to your feet. Please hurry.
Thank goodness you came! I am in desperate need of assistance. My daughter, Tandi, is missing. I do not know what to do!
Have you tried to save her?
Uhh?
aMy people are not skilled in this. Already three patrols have gone out to look, but none returned. Will you help me?
Okay. Who could have taken her?
I'll do it . . . for a fee.
I am sorry, but I have other things I have to do.
Seth and I believe one of the raider clans is responsible - retribution for our resistance to them. Take this spear. It was found where my daughter was last seen.
Okay, I'll check it out.
APlease, talk to Seth. He knows much about these raiders. And God speed, wanderer.
Of course, I will reward you. Bring her and you will receive  in Hub Script. Will you help me?
Okay. Who could have taken her?
Ah . . . no thanks. I got other stuff I gotta take care of.
As Dharma said, 'While you are out hunting the wolves, do not bring the lion to your den.' If you will not help, you must leave here.
I will be forever in your debt for your courage and bravery, wanderer. Here is your reward.
Thanks. Can I ask you a few more questions, first?
Thanks.
Until we meet again, my friend. May the water you find in the desert not shine at you in the dark.
What are you doing? Put that back at once!
That is not yours. Please do not take it.
Stop that at once!
What are you doing here? I am resting, come back in the morning!
I am he. I lead this humble town of Shady Sands.
ADharma was a great, religious man. You would do well to listen closely to his sayings.
She is my daughter. It is she that makes this hard life worth living.
Hmm, yes, yes. Razlo is our doctor. If it ails you, he can heal it. I would wager he is just a little north of here at this moment.
A fine young man, Seth. Captain of our guards. He is likely to be at the Guard House. 
A wonderful woman. She just celebrated her sixtieth birthday! She spends much time with Razlo, talking his ear off with her veritable treasure trove of stories.
Ummm, um, um. Very bad. There are two bands of raiders that we know of. They call themselves the Vipers and the Khans.
Be very careful with such as these. Raiders who are fanatically religious can be quite dangerous. No one here knows of their base.
Umm, yes, yes. The Khans are nastier then the Vipers, let me tell you. These barbarians attack from the southeast.
Mean creatures, they are. Be careful of their tail.
Their poison can be lethal if not looked after.
Yes, yes. yes. It is a rumor of a monster created during the War.
Junktown is south or here. Their merchants occasionally come to trade, but not often.
The Vipers and Khans both use spears. We know this from their attacks.
You will find it at the front of town. Seth will likely be there.
No one knows for certain, but the packs seem to be coming from the northeast.
I don't know.
I can't really say I have heard of that.
Hm, no. No, I have not heard of that.
As I said . . .
Like I mentioned earlier . . .
Like I said . . .
As I had told you before . . .
I shall not repeat myself so often as to make myself sound stupid. Please listen next time.
I will not stand here like a sputtering candle simply because you cannot listen.
Go talk to Seth about that. He'll know more than I.

I will not waste my time on treacherous outsiders.
 tell me about generic responses
I don't know.
I can't really say I have heard of that.
Hm, no. No, I have not heard of that.

You see damaged Power Armor.
You cannot use this until it is repaired.

It is obvious that you do not yet have the skill to repair this.
You repair the armor.
That does nothing.
You fail to repair the armor.
You gain 
experience points for repairing the power armor.
Kalnor, a Junktown guard.
You'd better watch yourself here.
This isn't a good town to get in trouble in.
Behave, and we won't have to get nasty.
You're OK.
Keep up the good work.
Nice day, isn't it?
This is Junktown. Nice place to live, as long as you stay on our good side.
Watch out for Gizmo and his cronies.
I like my boss.
You'd better put that away. Junktown is a friendly place, friend, and we want to keep it that way.
Put what away?
Don't tell me what to do, loser boy.
Sounds fair. By the way, what is the local law regarding weapons?
Uh, oh.
Your weapon, idiot. Killian won't take your arms away, but you'd better damn well keep them in your holster.
Oh, sorry.
No way! I'm not putting down my shooters for nobody!
You'd better behave, since it's the law, and I enforce the law. Put your weapon away. Don't draw it unless in self-defense and you won't have a problem with us guards. Disobey the law and we will return you to the lawless wasteland--dead or alive.
Sure, since you put it that way.
Bite your laws!
Well, uh, fine with me. But you'd better be careful.
Good you asked. No weapons can be drawn except in self-defense. If you start a fight, it's your fault. Other than that, it's your right to go around armed. Just don't pull a knife or gun without just cause. Have a good day.
Hey you, no weapons! And I don't care if your momma dropped you on our head as a kid. No weapons.
Hey! You! What are you doing sneaking around?
Nothing.
I'm not sneaking around. I just like to walk cautiously.
Uhhh.
Whatever you're doing, don't do it in this town.
Hey! No shady characters in town! Get out of here before we throw you out!
Well, uh, OK. Whatever. Just don't do anything out of line.
Thanks, bye.
Certainly. I will throw caution to the wind, sir.
Certainly. I will throw caution to the wind, ma'am.
You'd better watch your step around here, because we'll be watching you.
Welcome to Junktown. What can I do for you?
Nothing, thanks.
What are you doing here? What is this place?
Where can I get some supplies?
Wa-wa!
I dunno about that. You might want to check with Killian. He's to the north. That's up that way, OK?
What does it look like? I'm a guard, and I'm keeping an eye out for strangers like you. And this place is called Junktown. Hey, don't laugh. I happen to like the name myself. We mostly do trading. Sometimes we trade with those stuck up bastards from Hub. Hey, you're not from the Hub are you?
What? The Hub? Sure I am!
Me? No, I'm not from the Hub.
Then you must know most of the rules. Have a good day. And I am sorry about the bastards part, OK?
Yeah! Hey, no problem. Bye.
It's going to cause me some severe mental trauma. Later.
Hmmm. OK. It's not our place to ask questions. Have a good day and don't make any trouble.
Oh, heck. The place for that is Darkwater's. Killian runs it. It's a little to the north. Killian has the best supplies in town.
Thanks. Bye.
You wanna show me where you keep "your" supplies?
Uh, no. Sorry, lady. I got work to do here.
Have a nice day.
Keep out of trouble.
Boy, I sure hope my replacement gets here soon. It feels like I've been standing guard duty forever.
I'm sorry, the gates are closed for the night. Come back in the morning.
Hey, I need to get in!
No problem. See you in the morning.
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but I would like to enter your town. You can see that I would cause no harm.
Hunh-huh!
Come . . . back . . . day . . .
Sorry, the rules are the rules. No strangers admitted during the night.
Well, I shouldn't do this, but you seem like a nice enough person. Come on in, but don't make any trouble.
Hey! It's you! Come on in, 
. Good to see you again!
Hey, you'd better turn right around and walk back out of here.
Go on in.
Hey buddy, can you spare some change?
I'm tryin' to drink here!
I don't feel so good.
Man, I gotta get some work.
Could you pass the peanuts?
Not drunk enough . . .

Sorry man, but you passed the point of no return with us. Time to slam off!
Sorry woman, but you passed the point of no return with us. Time to slam off!
Why would I want to talk with someone who goes around killing kids? Get out of my face!
I hear you're pretty tough. But tough don't impress Ton. You got something to say or you wanna get it on? Let's do it!
Peace, brother! I'm just checking the place out.
I'm not interested in impressing you. You got something intelligent to say, say it!
Get it on? Mister, I don't go for scrawny little boys.
What do you want?
You talk too much.
You wanna die, and I wanna kill someone. Works for me.
Waa!
Man, I already talked to you! Take your shit somewhere else!
boy
girl
Hey, you think your weapon's gonna earn you some 'spect? It's gonna earn you a grave, man. Put it away.
Hey, you think your weapon's gonna earn you some 'spect? It's gonna earn you a grave, girl. Put it away.
What do you want, you stupid zombie? Get outta my face before I break it.
I was looking for someone smart enough to tell me what's really going on around this joint!
What will the priests say if they hear you talking like this?
Any time, pal. I've been waiting for a good scrap!
Hey, what's the problem? A few drinks and we'll be buds!
Did you know that even a child can apply enough pressure to the right spot in your kneecap to cripple you for life? Just thought you'd want to know.
You wanna talk to Ton? Fine. But if I hear the word "praise," I'll kill you.
You're not a big fan of worship services?
What's your problem, pal?
I want to speak with the man in charge.
Sure thing. The only thing I feel like praising is a bottle of Rad Scorpion.
Fine. The first one of us who says that word dies. Bargain?
Hello, miss. I am Ton, , pounds of the Master's toughest fighter. I have also been evolved by the FEV into something that you need to check out. Let's get it on, baby.
No way in hell.
That's a little too fast. Let's get to know each other first.
Hello. I've been evolved by the FEV so that anyone that annoys me dies. Stop annoying me, little man.
Check it out somewhere else. Ton don't like your company.
Fine. You want to play it straight? Sometimes killing's necessary. Sometimes I even like it. But I hear you love killing . . . all the time. Every time I've met a psycho, either he dies, or Ton dies. Ton is still here. So why don't you go elsewhere.
Man, I could learn to like you. You're either an incredible asshole, or you got guts. Either way is fine with Ton, as long as you don't jam me up. You want to join up?
Whatever happened to peace and love?
What's involved?
No way in hell, pal.
I'll jam whatever I want, wherever I want. So let's kick out the jams!
To see you suffer. Let's go, hombre, give me what I want.
Beware of what you want. You may not like what you get.
I'd rather be your friend.
You aren't worth my time.
Go ahead. Make the first move. The last one's mine.
Fine. Talking's over. Make your move.
I just wanted to talk.
You're dead . . .
Shit! You're dumber than the zombies! Just get out of here!
The Master wants peace, and he wants us to get it for him, so we're going to have fun. Capiche?
Yeah, but there's got to be more going on than just that.
Does the Master really want peace or does he just want killing?
Who is this Master?
Sounds good to me.
Screw the Master! Let's kill them all!
It's not healthy to ask the wrong question, compadre. They have all the answers they want you to hear. People who ask the wrong questions, or people who screw up, well, they don't stay around here very long.
I do my job. They like it when I do my job. They like it when street trash and Followers stop breathing. It lets the Nightkin do other things. Don't mess with me . . . it ain't healthy.
What are you doing dressed like a zombie? If you got the 'tude, you gotta let it show!
I don't care about the clothes, man. I just want to know what's going on here!
They don't bother you as much if you don't look like they might want to convert you.
None of your business, pal.
I've been thinking of converting.
It ain't 'tude. It's a way of death.
We don't drink in here. Nightkin don't like it. You better get a few more clues before you talk to Ton again.
You're crazy! I could almost like you, except that I have the feeling that people who hang around you don't live long. Get the hell out of here.
You stand around this for months and you go crazy as them. What do you want from Ton?
How'd these people get like this?
I want sex and violence, without the sex. You know where I can get it?
I am losing it in this zombie pit, and I don't need you helping me. Get the hell away from me.
That's Morpheus. He stays upstairs, except to give sermons. He don't even do that much anymore. He's smart and he's a winner, and that's all that counts. Go see him for yourself.
You need to go out into the Boneyard, pal. Ain't no slosh in here, and I've looked!
Agree. What can Ton do for you?
Bitch! You don't know what you're missing! Get out!
Life is too short for that. Let me show you why you don't want to wait.
But I want someone who knows what's going on.
No thank you. But I wouldn't mind being friends.
Get lost, you piece of trash.
Sure.
Life IS shorter than you think. Die, asshole!
I'm not LITTLE, bitch!
Who believes in that bullshit? They have to program these morons to believe in that stuff anyway.
How did it happen?
Really?
What a bunch of losers.
Tell me more about your posse.
Okay, I'll join up.
Someone should put them out of their misery. Like me . . .
When we get the word, we go out and kill people. People like the Followers or some of the more dangerous gang types.
So the Followers are a problem?
This sounds pretty sick to me.
Who needs the word? Why not just kill them?
Fine. Do what you want. But I'd get out before it becomes unhealthy around here.
You annoying little piece of shit. You're worse than a Junktowner, you coward. Get the hell out.
What else is there to know? I get to eat well, sleep in peace and kill some of the people who used to screw me over. You want something more from life?
Who knows? Who cares? I get to eat well, sleep in peace and kill some of the people who used to screw me over. You want something more from life?
Hmmm, Ton never thought of that. But if they bother me too much, I break their face. Then they stop bothering Ton. What do you want?
Converting? Well, good luck. You'll need it.
Why would I need luck?
That doesn't sound good.
Thanks. You're a true friend.
I don't need luck as long as I've got ammo.
These people, these zombies, weren't always like this. I could even stand a few of them. Then they got converted. Some of them came out like this. Some of them didn't come out at all. Ton doesn't like it, but these people pay Ton well.
Why do you keep jumping between first and third person?
Tell me more about the conversion process.
Did you go through the conversion process?
This place is strictly low-rent.
Really, how much?
Nobody's gonna do this to me!
You talk to Morpheus or to Lasher, or you can bother Ton, and Ton give you more violence than you can handle.
Well baby, what's going on is that there are a lot of zombies chanting, a lot of people dying and the Children are going to take over everything. And there's you and me and nothing else matters!
But Barracas, darling, surely there's more going on than that . . .
Oh, Ton!
Forget it, creep. You ain't my type.
Nothing else matters? Hell no! I wanna hear about the dying part!
Unfortunately, this is the worst place on earth to experience what Ton does best. Too many zombies cramp my style. I'll let you know when I think about some place more convenient . . .
You'll find out soon enough what happens upstairs. If you tough, you get through it fine. It happened to Ton, and Ton is just fine!
Uh . . . I didn't say anything. You forget what Ton told you or Ton will make you forget, permanently!
They used to be whiners. But Ton talks too much. You get out of my face.
Fine. You stay low-profile until I give you the word. Then we have fun.
They're cowards. They set ambushes against our patrols. They send spies and saboteurs. They know they can't win a real fight. The Master says we should feel sorry for them, but Ton just want to kill them. Smart man, Ton.
We need discipline, fool! We're soldiers now! We obey orders. Killers die, but soldiers win their battles. We're going to beat the Followers. We're going to beat EVERYONE!
Who the hell knows? Maybe it's just Morpheus pulling the strings. Things are good, and if this dries up, Ton goes somewhere else.
Well, don't get too eager. Even with the Nightkin, it's still tough fighting. But if we play it smart, we get out ahead. That's the only thing Ton cares about.
The conversion isn't easy. You see these people, all these zombies? They used to be like you and me. Ton survived. These people didn't. But why should Ton care about you?
You don't like the way Ton talk? Then Ton kill you!
Ton go through it fine. I . . . uh . . . I . . . uh . . . Ton . . . Ton just fine.
I used to be with the Dead Dog gang. Always hungry, always tired. This place is much better for Ton. Why should I worry about anyone else? Nobody ever worry about me.
You greedy asshole! Get outta here before Ton kills you!
Then get out of here now, before it's too late.
Nothing important as you and me. Unfortunately, this is the worst place on earth to experience what Ton does best. Too many zombies cramp my style. I'll let you know when I think about some place more convenient . . .
Why you manipulative bitch! Nobody screws with Ton like that!
You have enraged Barry!
You see Barry.
Hey! Only ghouls get a water ration.
I'm gonna get you for waking me up!
The mutant ignores you.
I dunno.
Yer standin in it.
He's a wus. We should just wipe out him and his ghouls.
That's here.
I dunno.
He Harry's boss.
Wimpy things.
Wimpier than ghouls.
You see Billy.
Hi there.
Hi, what are you doing?
Can I have a brahmin?
Hi. Uh, bye.
Arg!
Ta.
Why would you want a brahmin? Do you have a Caravan? Well, it doesn't matter. I only take care of them. Dan is the one that owns them; he won't sell them though.
Why?
I was just kidding.
Cuz of all the missing caravans. He doesn't have any to spare, the caravans use most of them. The others are sold for food. Well, I better stop talking; Dan will get mad if he sees me talking to a stranger.
Oh, okay.
Nothing . . . I mean, I'm taking care of the brahmin.
What's the spear for? Are they dangerous?
What's a brahmin?
What's a brahmin? You must be joking. Why they're one of the major food sources and forms of transportation around here. They haul the caravans. Dan says this is a really important job, but it's the Bone.
Oh, I knew that!
Dan's right. You are doing a great job.
Yea, it looks that way. Have fun.
Hey, you're one of those skags aren't you?
Really? You think so? Gee, thanks.
You're not from around here, are you? I'll give you one tip: Don't get caught stealing!
Sure, thanks.
I wouldn't dream of stealing. Stealing is wrong.
Yea, I think I'm starting to agree with you. This job isn't so bad, really. It makes me feel good for some reason. Well, I've got to go before I get in trouble.
Please don't hurt me or my brahmin.
Don't hurt me!
Stop it!
Please leave me alone.
You're scaring me.
Hey what are you trying to do? I don't have anything you'd want.
Stop that!
Dangerous? No, not really. They can give you a really nasty bite, but they're pretty cool. They fart and burp a lot. I don't know why.
So what's the spear for?
Okay, thanks.
Oh, they can be awfully stubborn when I want them to do something. I just gently stick them to get them to move around . . . plus I don't want to get too close; they sometimes kick. 
Please don't talk to me. Dan is going to yell at me again. He really gets pissed - I mean - mad, when I'm not paying attention to what I'm doing.
He's just trying to help. Work hard and I'm sure he'll be nicer.
Here kid, take  bucks and get away from this jerk.
Okay.
Aaaaaarg!
Rhu?
Please don't, I'm already in enough trouble.
I AM working hard!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. He's just trying to help you.
No you aren't, you lazy little skeev!
Okay. 
Yea, maybe you're right . . . actually, he seems pretty cool, but I wish he wouldn't yell at me so much.
Yea, right.
Up yours, you old fart!
Up yours, you old hag!
WOW! I can live on this for the rest of my life! Thanks a lot, mister!
WOW! I can live on this for the rest of my life! Thanks a lot, ma'am!
WOW! Thanks . . . Well? . . . You're just trying to get me in trouble again!
Please don't talk to me, Dan is really mad.
Don't worry. I had a talk with him, he'll try to be nicer to you.
And he should be! You're a terrible kid!
Wac.
Hi!
Those girls over there sure are dumb.
Hi again.
Brahmin are cool.
Dan's taking me to the Falcon if I do a good job.
Dan's going to take me on a caravan some day!
I'm going to be an adventurer when I grow up.
Really? Oh, okay. I hope you didn't hurt him. He's really not so bad. He just yells a lot.
Hello again.
What is it you do again?
Can I have a brahmin?
Just stopping by to see how things are going. Bye.
Arg!
Ta.
I'd better get back to work.
Those girls over there sure are dumb.
Hi again.
I'm going to be an adventurer when I grow up.
Brahmin sure do shi . . . uh, poop a lot.
I can't talk right now.
I don't want to get in trouble.
You see Bob, proprietor of Bob's Iguana Bits.
Ok, Ok, I've got your money.
I've got more expenses. I need to increase the payment.
Screw this. I want ALL of your money now, or you're a dead Bob.
I can't take the heat. I'm calling off the payments.
I want information on Decker.
I want information on Doc Morbid.
Gimme' an iguana on a stick.
I'm sorry. I ain't payin' no more. Do what you want with me.
Bob, I thought we were pals! In fact, I was thinking about giving you a promotion in my organization. Instead, you betray me. This is very disappointing...
Bob, why should I take no for an answer? Especially from a scumbag like you?
Glad to see you're standing up for yourself.
Your reputation is history, Bob. Hi-sto-ree!
Fine, I'll decide what to do with you later.
Well, it was nice knowing you Bob. Say 'hi' to Satan for me.
What are you doing back so soon? It ain't time for the payment.
You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. Get lost!
Hey, I don't want any trouble!
Hi! Welcome to Bob's Iguana Bits, the family eating place. Can I take your order?
Forget it.
You are? Well, Ok...
He's a mean son of a bitch. You don't want to mess with him. Anything else?
Fine. What do you want me to pay?
I want 
 bucks every five days.
Doc Morbid? All I know is that he's up around Junktown and he's the cheapest source of food I could find. That's all!
Let's see what I've got in stock.
I've got a whole iguana for twenty caps.
I've got prime cut choice for eight caps.
I'll take one of the real ones.
Nothing for me right now. I'm on a diet.
I'll take one of the prime cuts.
I could go for some prime cut right now. I'll even pay for it.
Uhh... Me no hungry now.
Fine! Take your money and get out!
You can stick it! I ain't ever payin' you! Get lost!
Yeah, sure. Why don't you find someone else to screw over.
You can't throw crap without getting some of it on your fingers. Get out of here!
Sure you will. Get lost!
Sorry. We're all out of iguana.
We only have whole iguana on a stick. Twenty bucks each.
We only have prime select choice. It tastes great, though. Eight bucks each.
Sure. We got whole iguana on a stick for twenty bucks, and our prime select pieces for eight bucks.
I'll take a whole iguana.
I'll take your prime select.
You know, I hear your prime select tastes like chicken. Do you like eating cowardly guys?
No sissy portions! Me want all iguana! Ugh!
Hmm, smell good! Me want prime!
Never seen any of them around here. Water Merchants don't need 'em.
Water Merchants?
Mr. Decker is a distinguished businessman in a less than distinguished business. Anything else?

What kind of business?
What are you talking about?
Your secret ingredients. How fresh does the corpse have to be before it develops a bitter aftertaste? Do you use mutants, humans, or a mix?
I found an invoice in Doc Morbid's lair. An invoice for dead bodies...
If you've got a memory loss, I can talk to the sheriff.
Prime Choice Select is made of people!!!! It's made of people!!!
Nothing. Sorry to bring it up. Now is there anything else I can do for you?
Well, he's dead now, and my cash flow has increased because of it.
Someone killed Decker. We're in mourning. [snicker]
Someone shot Sheriff Greene. Don't know about the deputy, though.
Daren Hightower was murdered. And all that money couldn't save him. Ironic, ain't it?
Someone stole a necklace from the Hightowers. Man, did they ever make a big mistake. They're dead for sure!
Someone killed Jain over at the Cathedral. I hear she was a real pain in the butt!
Well, the only new thing is that the Children of the Cathedral has taken over the Hospital. It's pretty boring around here lately.
Anything else?
Man, I'm gonna be out of business in a week. Anything else, oh high and mighty?
I don't like your attitude.
Sorry, you can't afford it.
One whole iguana coming up! Anything else?
You know what they're made from and you still want one? You make Decker look like a charity worker! Anything else?
I don't like your attitude.
Sorry, you can't afford it.
One iguana prime select choice, coming up! Anything else?
Smart choice. You could stand to lose a few pounds.
Wh...what! Oh, I see, you're joking...
Of course I am...
No, I'm not. I'm going to see that you pay for your crime.
No, I'm not. And I want a piece of the action.
You must be new in town if you're asking me about the Water Merchants. Water is life, and you don't get much more powerful than life and death.
Who's in charge of the Water Merchants?
If there's anything that involves misery and suffering in the Hub, Decker either controls it or wants to control it. Anything else?
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't appreciate your slander! I suggest you don't show your face in here again.
Don't do that! Fine, I've been using some questionable portions. But it's not like I'm committing murder. Doc Morbid's stuff is already dead, isn't it?
I'm sure it is, Bob. Have a nice day...
Cannibalism is a crime against humanity, Bob. I'm going to see that you pay for it.
Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. I don't care. I want a piece of the action.
Not so loud! I don't need you saying that all over the Hub...
I guess I was rude. Have a nice day...
You know, the police station is just across the street. I really should take a little walk.
I can get even louder. But I can also shut up. Noise is cheap, silence is expensive.
How the hell am I gonna pay you if you eat all my stock? Fine! Have another iguana! I hope you choke on it!
I don't like your attitude.
Tough. You want money, I'll give it to you. You want food, I'll give it to you. You want to die, I'll arrange it. But "like" ain't part of the equation.
Nothing I can think of. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a business to run.
Sorry, we're all out of iguana.
We only have whole iguana on a stick. Twenty bucks.
We only have prime select choice. Eight bucks.
Again? Man you must be hungry. We got whole iguana on a stick for twenty bucks, and our prime select pieces for eight bucks.
I'll take a whole iguana.
I'll take your prime select.
You know, I hear your prime select tastes like chicken. Do you like eating cowardly guys?
No sissy portions! Me want all iguana! Ugh!
Hmm, smell good! Me want prime!
How the hell am I gonna pay you if you eat all my stock? Fine! Have another iguana! I hope you choke on it!
I don't like your attitude.
Uh, bye.
Wait a minute. We've got to find a way to reach a mutual understanding!
The only way you'll be able to keep me quiet is to kill me.
Sorry, no deal.
Fine. What can I get out of this?
Fine. What do you want me to pay?
I want bucks every five days.
I don't think I'll blackmail you. Carry on.
I'd change your mind if I were you, friend. People have died for less in the Hub.
Fine. It's a deal. 
bucks, due every five days. I guess I'll see you in five...
No way I'm going for that. I can't afford more than what I'm paying you now.
Too bad, Bob. I'd hate to start singing.
Fine. We'll stay with the current arrangement... for now.
Can you afford a funeral, Bob?
Fine. Maybe it would be good if our paths didn't cross again.
You may be a songbird, but I'm the golden goose. You ain't gonna sing, not when I'm the only goose you've got. Now get out!
First sensible thing I remember you saying. Now get out!
Gimme' an iguana on a stick.
What can you tell me about a Water Chip?
What can you tell me about Decker?
I think we need to talk about Doc Morbid and some of your secret ingredients.
Do you know anything about the missing caravans?
What, me trouble? What gives you that impression?
Anything interesting happening in the Hub?
Me hungry! Grrrrr!
Terrible business. Those poor people. Oh, those poor people. Losing their lives in such a ghastly way! Is there anything else I can do for you? Like feed you, perhaps?
Nothing, bye.
Me go now.
