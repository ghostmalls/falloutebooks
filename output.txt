and it was always playing here in the casino dammit, if i'd only brought a recording inside so, what, you're trying to recover it?

he pockets the moneyalright then, here's the drink
he resides on level , as he mustwhy do you ask such a silly question?
he said he understood what it meant to track someone who had such a impact on his past life.
he said people were like couriers, sometimes never understanding the messages they broughtfrowns that's who he was hunting for some courier.
he saw me, before the scars, at a place far from hereit's where he found some of the technology he uses now.
he wants to out-fight the legion in a straight-forward slugging match, and then, when they rout, pursue and destroy them in detail.
he was trying to figure out if I recognized him and see if my throat healedi'll deal with you first, then i'll deal with him.

he's my teacherhe says every lash we receive brings us closer to the master!
he's not about to let anyone else in, so I guess that's how it'll have to be.
he's the deadliest person in the hub; most say that he runs this place, not the merchants or the policeif you ever cross him, watch out.
he's the head of the crimson caravan.
he's the head of the policenice guy, if you like the straight arrow, honest typenot like his father; now there was a loyal man.
he's the head of the water merchants.
he's the tree, you seewe're old pals the best of buddies and we know each other inside and out; literally.

how the hell am I gonna pay you if you eat all my stock? fine! have another iguana! I hope you choke on it!

hubip.
huh. and here I thought we had the only remaining copy of that... {surprised, but muttered under breath.}
huh?
huhnever thought of thatmakes sense, thoughgood idea.

i already told you about the stahl boy's drug problem. you said you wanted to help.
i already told youhe's dead! let's just forget about him, his name brings back bad memories.

i can't see as how i'd charge you after the generous things you've done for the townthe room's on me.

i can't wait to see the stripi hear it's so beautiful!
i care because he is a known quantity - not the man so much as the political context he inhabits.
i certainly didn't raise you to behave like that.
i changed my mind I don't want any alcoholbye
i coughs I wish you luck in the vaultelijah he's tough to pin downchristine's voice is restored, wishes the player luck in the vault.

i could've sworn we were under attackdid you see those rockets?
i da know.
i da knowask mommy.
i didn't ask you to tell me what they were planning, I asked you to kill themthis was a waste of time.
i didn't askbut since you obviously don't have any concept of fun, I think I will end your existence.
i didn't know at firstthen the old man showed upyou showed upthen that woman showed up, covered in scars.
i didn't receive any clear video of the incidents, but telemetry from the units destroyed indicates they were attacked with energy weapons.
i didn't want to attract the attention of groups like the great khans or the brotherhood of steelalas, the real threat was closer to home.
i didn't want to herd brahmin for a living, so I signed on with the crimson caravan and headed eastnot much to tell, really.
i didn'tmy c.oordered me to flog a couple "deserters," and I told him to eat shitso they kicked me out for insubordination.

i don't have to tell you anything.
i don't know what else the brass expects half these kids don't get more than two weeks of training before they ship 'em out here.
i don't know what they're up to and I don't want to knowi just hope no harm comes to novac.
i don't know what you're getting at, but I can assure you nothing 'sick' is going on at the brotherhood.
i don't know what you're talking about, and I don't appreciate your slander! I suggest you don't show your face in here again.
i don't know which is truei see a lot, I think a lotthere's a lot to hear through the 188, too, that maybe accounts for the thinking.
i don't know why they say cathedral twicewe worship the master, and we yell a lot about peace and unityit sounds kind of dumb, but the master's real smart, so I guess it must be okay.
i don't know.
i don't knowshe might need to hold some place where speaking isn't importantlike stage tech? lighting? got me.
i don't like your attitude.
i don't mean to be insensitive, but you really can't winapologetically
i don't mean to be rude, but you're not allowed hereyou'd better leave before i'm forced to take preventive measures.
i don't much like you.
i don't need luck as long as i've got ammo.
i don't need to answer you.
i don't need you - i'll send you back to the farm, worse off than you were, because you'll have seen the sierra madre, and had to let it emphall goholotape recording, getting tenserdean's about to tell vera she's going to do the job, no matter what.
i don't promote political assassination as a first option, but it has a long and storied historyi'll consider the boomers neutralized.
i don't really know how to tell you thisi hope you'll understand, but I know you might be angrypause at the beginning, like he's trying to think of what to say
i don't see anything wrong with you.
i don't suppose you forgot to search his body?
i don't think i'll blackmail youcarry on.
i don't think so slick.
i don't think so.
i don't think they want your type of excitement.
i don't think we got any more to discuss here.
i don't understand, the power cells keep shorting out.
i don't want to get in trouble.
i don't want to talk to you.
i don't want you harming a hair on that man's head - assuming you can find one.
i don't want your corpse stinking up our little patch of heaven. {jokingly sarcastic}

i dunno.
i dunnoaround here somewhere.

i expect that if benny doesn't have the chip, caesar will make sure you get itmore on that laterbe off.
i feel lousydo you know how long it's been since I killed anything?
i figure a guy like you gets his pick of killing gear(>40)
i found an invoice in doc morbid's lairan invoice for dead bodies

i give out flowersevery petal is peace, and the stem is unityor are the petals unity and the stem peace? oh no, I don't remember! do you want one?
i got all the basics covered, as long as I have the chips to pay for themi don't need much.
i got the feeling she was trying to get boone to leave with her, but I guess she got tired of waiting.
i grew up not far from here, and though I traveled the old world extensively, I never found another place like it.
i guess I can let you back into the gangonce a snake, always a snake, huh? let's roll!

i have nothing to say.
i have something to sell.
i have to get through this force fieldplease lower it.
i have to say, of all the rat infested hellholes that i've lived in, this one is the least hellish.
i have to think that he found out about the platinum chip and mistakenly convinced himself that he could use it to his own ends.
i have work to dodo you?

i hope you're finding everything to your liking.
i hope you've got this one under control, because he's giving me a nasty itch on my trigger finger.
i I didn't want this to happensighs ending him is more important than saving youfor what it's worth i'm sorry.
i invite you to think carefully about what you do next standing alone before me, surrounded by my heavily-armed securitron guards.
i just know what i've heardthere's supposed to be some ghouls that went in a while back.
i just need you to head over to the east power plant and manually activate the switch.
i just wanted to talk.
i knew benny was ambitious, even ruthlessbut I believed he would do the job, so long as he was incentivized appropriately.
i knew I couldn't "save the world," nor did I care tobut I could save vegas, and in the process, perhaps, save mankind.
i knew it was only a matter of time before an army appeared, to take control of the damand I knew my securitrons wouldn't be enough to oppose them.
i knew you where going to waste my time again.
i knew you wouldthat's why I picked you when I saw you coming.
i knew you'd make itresourceful, as always.

i know it's hard for you to trust, but I would like to help.
i know of no village to the west.
i know that. the people will see the results shortly, I assure you.
i know they mean well and for awhile it was nice to be neededbut i'm not sure I want to be a giant tree anymore.
i know what's out thereit's why i've planted a mine field, shotguns, and explosives all the way on the road to my little boudoir here.
i know you can, and that's goodi'm not always going to be here to take care of youyou've got to learn to fend for yourself.
i know you didn't do it out of the goodness of your heartso instead of empty words and a flourish, let me give you something more useful.

i knowand he pause will kill me, I can't get the collar offeven if I could, I need to be sure - see his eyes, his face, when he dies.
i knowthe sealed doors, the security it's almost a fortressthink that's why we're being ordered to come here and crack it open?
i like hearing the dj, three dog and how he's helping to fight the good fight.
i like my boss.
i like to think you have enough sense to do the right thingthe rewards for doing so are immense as are the punishments for not doing so.
i look so good in this shit, I want you to call me fucking spectacular from now on.
i lost everything I had at the tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, i'd head straight backsick, huh?
i love the sight of a limping waster. you just look like a walking pile of caps to me.
i mean you no harm, really.
i mean, butch is down for action, but you you're a psycho!
i mean, if I had a few of those holograms or a few hundred surrounding me, maybei'd settle for two, enough to cover a quick exit.
i mean, you're kind of a jerk sometimes, and you make it work up thereso why not me?
i meant to do that.
i might let you sell me something, it better be good.
i much prefer working with robots
i must confess feeling a bit disappointed in youbut these things happenyou will remember this is confidentialgood day.
i must insist that you stay long for me to show you what the chip doesi promise you'll like what you see
i mustn't let that happen! that's why this place exists.
i need a lighter
i need other people's thoughts to fill my head when i'm not thinking myselfotherwise it's kind of empty.
i need to take off my medicine
i need to talk to a knight.
i need you to manually upload the data from the chip to the facility's primary computerthere's a terminal at the other end of this facility.
i needed the operating software on the platinum chip to bring it back online.
i never do good enough! never!
i no give you
i no speak to you.
i noticed the signal lag as soon as you arrived on the floorcollar detonator signal's down to a dull thud, more like a heartbeat than a screech.
i offer many benefits, but vacation time isn't one of them.
i once visited a crematorium that gave discounts for burn victims.
i oversaw the city's renovations starting from 2274 onwardthe three families are my employees.
i picked up some stealth boys the other day, and they seemed like just the way to thank you for your investmentkudos!
i prefer the term "autocrat."
i put her in the clinic, tuned her like an instrumentif she heals up, it's not going to be her voice speaking any more.
i really hope that incident at repconn doesn't drive people awaynovac was starting to do well!
i really wish I could, man, but three's a crowd, you know? i'll just stay here for now.
i recommend following the securitron's instructionsits programming is beat strict, and I don't have time to change it.
i recruited a tribal force to supplement my securitrons and renovated the strip just in time to welcome the ncr as it marched into the region.
i sat down at a roulette table with my life savingsan hour later, it was gone.
i scour the wasteland for the very best pieces of trash, the height of detritus, and the veritable pick of the litterit's all valuable to someoneusing flowery words to sell bullshit
i see - you're in a predicament.
i see how it is sigh what do you need?
i see my assistant will show you to the door.
i see you have disposed of my secondi will have to take care of you myself.
i seeyou seem to be doing pretty well.
i sense the untruth behind your wordsyou will not be allowed inthis I promise you
i sent someone like yourself after the declarationshe did some of the research for me, but now I haven't seen her in a few months.
i set to work immediatelyi thought I had plenty of time to prepareas it turned out, I was 20 hours short.
i shall not repeat myself so often as to make myself sound stupidplease listen next time.
i should be thankful, in a second, it'll give me another gift - with any luck, security'll leave enough of your ashes for an urn on my mantle.
i should compensate you as though it were an official assignment, howeverwouldn't want to beat disincentivize your proactivity.cash out omerta quest
i should have known the little bastard was conspiring against me.
i spent the next few decades in a veritable comabut I survived, obviously - and eventually thrived.
i suppose I can help you outwhat do you want?
i suppose i'm going to have to do something about thatheavy sigh at the beginning of the sentence
i suppose this qualifies as an emergency, so i'm not complainingmuch.
i suppose you're right when the legion assaults hoover dam, my securitrons will be waiting for the omertasthey won't accomplish much.
i surmise it's standard practice for the brotherhood to install a self-destruct systemit's consistent with their disdain uncompromising nature.
i suspected he'd found a way to access my encrypted databases, but well - this explains it.
i swear if I try real hard, I can see all around me like my eyes are in every leaf on every tree.
i swear! I don't know anything about the terminal! ask novashe's all over moriarty all the time.
i tell these assholes to just stop looking in the mirror. but if you want to mess up your face, try pinkerton at rivet city. he's crazy enough.
i tell you, your old man had the right ideai can't stand it down here anymoreyou gotta help me get out.
i think he gets lonely standing around in that dino belly all dayhe'll be glad for the company.
i think he's jealous!
i think I will make their lives boring againi'll start with you!
i think it's making bob kind of jealous, cause he was the first tree in my life and all that.
i think that's what's taking the caravansit could also be the brotherhood of steel; they're a strange bunchsome people think it's the water merchants, but they're wrong.
i think the best way for you to get down there would be to get the key from the one those loonies call "cypress."
i think we need to talk about doc morbid and some of your secret ingredients.
i think you'd better get out of here.
i think your kind is doomed, actuallyhere, let me prove it with some help from my friends .
i thought about it for a long time, but in the end I decided it was best for you not to know.
i thought I had seen every species of moronic petty bullshit, but you've just topped the listcongratulations.
i thought i'd be seeing you again.
i thought you might enjoy the honor of presenting them to the ncr's commanding officer, once the legion has been defeatedcheers!
i thought you'd be out there tearing up the wasteland and raising hell!
i thought you'd say that.
i told 'em I ain't seen nobody like that and set 'em on their way.
i told you before: i'll spare a few caps if you just tell each of the adults to get over to the voting booth sometime today.
i trust you know what you're doing.
i understand the road was difficult, so allow me to present you with an extra bonus to perhaps whet your appetite for future endeavors.
i understandsorry to be a bother.
i used to be with the dead dog gangalways hungry, always tiredthis place is much better for tonwhy should I worry about anyone else? nobody ever worry about me.
i used to know a ventriloquist with more skill than youat least he had the sense to know his own name, without carving it into his chest.
i waited an entire lifetime! sitting in that villa, watching it all fall apart - sinclair's sierra madre towering over everything? untouched?!
i walked all the way from hub! thought i'd rest my feet here a day or two, then I head onto the strip fresh.
i want

i want information on decker.
i want information on doc morbid.
i want nothing to do with you.
i want sex and violence, without the sexyou know where I can get it?
i want to buy something.

i want to tell you something nowit's important, so listen closely: this place, this vault it's not perfect, I knowbut it is your home.
i want you to open a hatch in the basement of the derelict weather station atop fortification hill.
i wanted some information..
i warned you!
i was able to snag the voice, beat downnote or thought I hadnormal tone the right tone and phrasing well, that may take some time.
i was exploring some sort of a military base with some other people I think it was called mariposa.
i was going to attend the clairvoyants meeting, but it was canceled due to unforeseen events.
i was just kidding.
i was like you oncei wandered into town looking for an escape from this stupid joke of a body i'm trapped innow look at me.
i was looking for someone smart enough to tell me what's really going on around this joint!
i was once a man a long time ago named haroldsomething in me changed and a weird little tree started growing right out of my head.
i was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?
i wasn't going to say anything, but when you walked in here I thought you were a ghoulwe better get to work on this quick.
i will admit, when you ignored my invitation, I predicted negative outcomesbut - you have a way of exceeding expectations, don't you?
i will award sydney's promised bounty to her personallyno need to worry yourself about that.

i will not say that again.
i will not stand here like a sputtering candle simply because you cannot listen.
i will not waste my time on treacherous outsiders.
i wish I could get a day off, it's been so lovely out.
i wish I could look the other way, but i'm afraid my programming is very strict.
i wish it was that simpleno, nothere's only one way you're going to be able to do this for me.
i wish someone would stand up to him one dayoh myi shouldn't be saying all of this!
i wish there was some other way we could have worked this out.
i wish we didn't have to invite him, but there just aren't that many children your age in the vault.
i wish you hadn't done that.
i won big my first night on the stripi kept chasing that feelingright into the gutter.
i won't lie to youit'll be dangerous.
i won'ti promise.
i would like to buy some of the alcohol you make here
i would rule as a chief executivei would not answer to a board of directors or any other entity.
i wouldn't dream of stealingstealing is wrong.
i wouldn't worry about itmany have died for causes far less grand than what you're about to undertake.
i'd be glad to sell it back to you, but you don't seem to have enough capscome back when you do.
i'd be glad to sell it back to youhere you go.
i'd be happy to take a look at what you've got.
i'd better get back to work.
i'd change your mind if I were you, friendpeople have died for less in the hub.
i'd get back to the hub, if I were you.
i'd hesitate to even call this a wound, but if you insist. 50 caps should cover my expenses.
i'd hesitate to even call this a wound, but if you insist50 caps should cover my expenses.
i'd hoped to have you investigate the omertas, but after the trouble you caused at gomorrah, they won't let you in the front door.
i'd like to play something special for you right nowbecause you deserve it.
i'd rather be your friend.
i'd sooner ask what makes me an undying son of a bitch than spend any thought as to why emph they crawled to life here.
i'd stay away from the bosshe's in one of his moods againmildly sarcastic
i'd try using that new gun of yours!
i'll advise you again to leave immediately or I cannot be responsible for the consequences.
i'll agree to harbor you for now. however, in exchange, you will reveal the secrets of your former nation to me or face exile.
i'll be happy to satisfy your disapproving rambunctious curiosity at a more appropriate momentbut now, i'll repeat my question
i'll be happy to satisfy your every curiosity once the platinum chip has been delivered.
i'll be here a while yet, if you need any guns or ammo.
i'll bet.
i'll check it outsee ya.
i'll come back when I have more money
i'll do it for a fee.
i'll expect to see some tangible progress before long, then.

i'll jam whatever I want, wherever I wantso let's kick out the jams!
i'll make you blue if you don't leave my customer's alone.
i'll miss you.
i'll see if I can make some progress with informantsyou're useless in this matter.
i'll send a securitron ahead to meet with the ncr at the security checkpoint and get things started.
i'll spare a few caps if you just tell each of the adults to get over to the voting booth sometime today so I cinch the victory.
i'll start a gang, of course! why, it'll be the toughest, coolest, badass-est gang the wasteland's ever seen!
i'll still give you the % discount, because I like you.
i'll take a whole iguana.
i'll take it if you tell me what's going on around here.
i'll take one if you tell me what's going on around here.
i'll take one of the prime cuts.
i'll take one of the real ones.

i'm a much better tactician than youit's all in the brain, you see.
i'm a salesmani swing through mccarran and the dam once a week or so to take ordersbut lately I spend most of my time in this piss heap.
i'm afraid i'm a very lethal killing machine.
i'm afraid that goes against patient-doctor confidentiality. {evasive}
i'm afraid that kind of behavior can't be tolerated.
i'm andrewmy job is to guard the jail.
i'm bringing a message to our leader.
i'm calling the tune here - this is my theater, my show, i've waited my life to get back hereyou? not even worth the time it'd take to kill youdean, pretends to have the upper hand against the player, defying him/her to hurry up and die.
i'm collecting artifactshistorical artifactsumall sorts of things from old dc.
i'm counting myself lucky I still have my faculties - they sure don'tthen again, they may not have had the focus I do.
i'm defender anne marie morgan with the outcasts. steer clear of here, and you should be able to continue with that whole "not dying" plan.
i'm defender anne marie morgan, with the outcasts. good to have someone else out here who can keep up.
i'm doc church and I run this clinic. now, before you go askin' me for help, you'd better know the rules. rule one: don't bother me.

i'm not interested in impressing youyou got something intelligent to say, say it!
i'm not little, bitch!
i'm not offering you an incentive as crude as money - though there'll be plenty of that.
i'm not one for church, but there's a bell tower to the north that has a nice view of the sierra madreto himself, remembering the cloudwell, did, anyway<dean tells the player that he's seen a bell tower to the north that should have an excellent view of the casino>
i'm not playing with a cheater like you
i'm not programmed to failjust so you knowapologetically
i'm not really comfortable having you in here, so make it quick.
i'm not sneaking aroundi just like to walk cautiously.

i'm saving an entire people from destruction!
i'm seriousone of the locals catches us, we aren't coming back - and i'd like to keep an eye on you.
i'm sick of the sob stories you hear around hereif you don't know when to stop gambling, that's no one's fault but your own.
i'm so glad I got drafted to be part of lyons' little water delivery teamno really, I can't tell you what a wonderful opportunity this all issarcastic
i'm so relieved we can put that unpleasantness behind us.
i'm sorry but I won't help you unless you put your weapon awaythis is a shop not an arena.
i'm sorry that you had to act that way.
i'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but I would like to enter your townyou can see that I would cause no harm.
i'm sorry to hear that.
i'm sorry you feel that waymaybe you haven't grown up as much as i'd thoughtif you don't want it, i'm sure I can find someone who does.
i'm sorry, but she is dead.
i'm sorry, but the president must be a citizen of the republic to run for office. so you do not qualify.
i'm sorry, but you're not allowed herei hope you won't turn this into an unpleasant situation.
i'm sorry, I didn't mean thathe's just trying to help you.
i'm sorry, I don't understandplease come back when you are feeling better.

i'm sorryi've been programmed to protect private property at all costs.
i'm sorryyou've entered a restricted areai may have to use deadly force if you don't leave immediately.
i'm sort of stuck herecolin says that I can't leave until I pay off my debt to himof course, he charges me room and board too.
i'm sure it is, bobhave a nice day
i'm sure the assassins will wait for you to show up.
i'm sure you've been many places, but you must have missed my tiny village.
i'm surprised you can still underestimate me after everything you've seen.
i'm surprised you made it in here. I can fix you up, but it'll run you 100 caps. what do you say?
i'm telling you, it is possible, or maybe i'm just losing my mind from all this boredom.
i'm the person who will pay you when you complete the delivery contract you signednow go get the chip.
i'm the town doc. if it's cut, I sew it up. if it's infected, I cut it off.
i'm tired of you're presence. leave the republic of dave within the hour, or i'll have you executed.
i'm tryin' to drink here!
i'm very proud of youyou're ruthless, an attribute I admirekane will give you your paymenti hope you're available in the future.
i'm working on some top secret shit I can't even tell you about, it's so mind-blowing.
i'm, uh, doing stuff.
i've always taken business negotiations seriouslyi advise you to do the same.
i've always taken business negotiations very seriouslyi advise you to do the sameduplicate.
i've been literally rooted to this spot thanks to bob for maybe twenty or thirty years I can't even remember anymore.
i've been thinking of converting.
i've calculated and re-calculated these probabilitieskimball must live.
i've got a whole iguana for twenty caps.
i've got more expensesi need to increase the payment.
i've got news for you.
i've got prime cut choice for eight caps.
i've got supplies, if you've got caps.
i've got the best goods, what are you looking for?
i've had enough of you and elijah running the showbeatnow it's my turn.
i've never expected loyalty, mind youa reliably underhanded tribe is just as constant to deal with as one that always run true.
i've never heard of anyone breaking their contract and still getting their payjanet is damn lucky.
i've resurrected vegas, spirit intactwhat I need now is the ability to enforce my rightful claim.
i've since broadcast the upgrade to every securitron in range of my transmitters, and I must say, it's causing quite a stir down on the strip!
i've spent too many years waiting for this moment to see it fumbled by an insubordinate contractor.
i've still got guns and ammo, if you need them.
i've tried to stay happy, really I havebloomseer poplar thinks i'll live for hundreds of years maybe even more!
i've waited this long, I suppose I can wait until someone else comes along to accept my offer.
i, i'm I can't remember was the leader of it maybe my holodisk the mutant weakly hands you a bloody holodisk
i, uh, left it in my other robe.
if he even thought I was talking to you, he'd tan my hide!
if I compell the ncr to retreat, kimball will be the sacrifice offered to the gods, so decent ncr citizens can get on with their lives.
if I could move, I would show you a thing or two, but bob has me stuck here.
if I remember correctly, there should be two holograms you can switch on in the area just don't remember how.
if I tell him we've heard of a legion assassination plot, I believe he'll let you investigate.
if it weren't for the water caravans, novac would've turned to dust a long time ago.
if it's an emergency, you can get chems for any uh conditionsinclair left that for doctors and trained professionals, not the common folk.
if it's just the same to you, I think i'll stay in towni feel safer that way.
if it's not one thing, it's anotherwell, got to runmildly sarcastic
if it's worth more to you than dying on golgotha because you welched on a debt, that's your problemi'd think
if not for you, president kimball would be deadso you needn't feel guilty when the ncr's rout from hoover dam demolishes his political career.
if not, then I want to make sure that the boomers don't sign similar treaties to fire their guns in support of the ncr or caesar's legion.
if she is one of those women from shady sands, maybe you should look therenow go, I need to finish sharpening my knives
if that's all, let's shake a leg.
if the capitol building does not meet your incredible standards, feel free to escort yourself out. in fact, just leave now.
if the omertas pose a threat to the physical or economic security of the vegas strip, I want you to do whatever it takes to neutralize that threat.
if the people of the wasteland are generous and respectful, I might deign to annex them.
if their leaders weren't scheming to steal vegas out from under me, i'd have no troubles with the ncr at all.
if there's anything that involves misery and suffering in the hub, decker either controls it or wants to control itanything else?
if these items were lost to time, how would we ever be able to explore our heritage or appreciate the sacrifices our founding fathers made?
if they call us outcasts for our dedication to duty, then we'll wear the title with pride!
if they find out someone's trespassing, it'd be shaking a hornet's nestdon't want to think how many of them could fill these streets.
if they survive the cloud, the ghost people, the traps, then greed takes over, and they start sizing each other up for funeral suits.
if this means more stuff for butch, i'm all for it.
if we're going there, i'm not going aloneand if you have any bright ideas about telling me to stroll over there - or leave me there? no thanks.
if you are lookin' to change your face, i'd try pinkerton at rivet city. that boy's got no sense of ethics. and you're a fool if you try it.
if you can even fix what happened to me when they jabbed the electrodes into my skull and turned my head into a flashlight.
if you can find it for me, i'd be sure to make it worth your while.
if you can get onto that terminal, I bet he has information on your dad.
if you can understand me, please try to find my daughter.

intruders!
ire a gun runner?
irritated, bad side starts coming out oh, of course you donow, it's like we're married with these big wedding rings around our necks.
irritated, basically asked to be a roadie "hold the wires, dean." beat talk about being a second stringer.
is a man with a strange hat, wielding a clubinterested? it's genuine pre-war memorabilia
is everything all right? awful late to be dropping in unexpected.
is it really so hard emphasis not to engage in cannibalism? my goodness
is that really necessary?
is that the best you can do?
is there anyplace in town I should avoid?
is there anything else I can do for you?
is there some reason I should be talking to you? disdaining
is this a trick question? I don't even see a scratch on you.
it ain't 'tudeit's a way of death.
it hasi gotta run though.
it is a pity that you act this way, but you will not proceed further
it is a quiet time, thankfully.
it is certain.
it is decidedly so.
it is good that the regulators are gone.
it is my town, wandereryou must answer my questions or leavethis is not a matter of choice.
it is obvious that you do not yet have the skill to repair this.
it is obvious to you that I built this place? the platinum chip opened it, after all?sigh - the burdens of intelligence
it is such a burden being the wisest.
it is unacceptable for you to enter the capitol building without an invitation!
it just ends up being a mish-mash of symbols, not letterscan still do math, formulas, equations rueful writing poetry's out.
it kept getting bigger until I ended up stuck insidewhen people would ask about it, I decided to name it bobyou know, like a friend or something.
it makes me so happy to hear that! feel free to look around all you like.
it means my c.owas an asshole, and I told him to eat shithe ordered me to flog a couple "deserters."
it needs to go to the strip and mccarran.
it seems diplomacy is not your forte.
it seems to be missing a part that you can't find.
it seems to have been human once, or at least descended from humans. you guess that the deteriation in the body is most likely due to acid or radiation.
it seems to have been human once, or at least descended from humansyou guess that the deteriation in the body is most likely due to acid or radiation.
it takes moxie to admit you've done something wrongi admire that.
it takes some real balls coming back here after everything you and your dad screwed up.
it was a long time ago I tend to lose track.
it was a place of splendoras magnificent as today's strip may seem, it's but a shadow of the neon paradise that was las vegas.
it was easy, manthey were going door to door asking if anyone knew any scientistsi said look no further.
it was nothingcan I ask you some more questions?
it was pretty tough, but I made it.
it was so fast my brothers were gone could not help
it was the day the united states of america earned its name and secured its place in history.
it was the only waythe only way to stop them.
it was to have been delivered by courier the following afternoon but by then, the world had ended.
it will also make any of the pesky rads you've accumulated in the wasteland vanish instantly.
it will be a true shame to see your head on a pike.
it won't be easy benny is always surrounded by at least four bodyguards - except when he's in his private suite on the 13th floor of the tops
it'll be a pitched battle, that's a certaintyperhaps the greatest battle the earth has seen since the human race nearly made itself extinct.
it's a big place built into a mountain far to the westmy people have been there for the last  years.
it's a facility I built many years before you were bornyou might think of it as a barracksyou'll understand soon enough.
it's a lie, kidi didn't do it!
it's a shame I regret itstill, you dames are all the same - things get a little hot, you get cold feetthat's why i'm still aliveyou? well
it's a shame that you had to do that.
it's a shame you've got to gobut you'll do okay out there, i'm surefirm
it's a sin to tell a lie
it's a small place that sells fair weaponsover by the far go traders.
it's a very special itemthere's nothing else like it in the entire worldit was lost a long time, and difficult to find.
it's a violation of their contracti authorize you to deal with them in any way you see fit.
it's a wild brahmin.
it's all going dark
it's been a while, I hope you've been well.
it's been greatcan I ask you some questions?
it's best if he can blame everything on me.
it's clearly a joke. no one's got the tech to do that without risking infection.
it's common knowledge that irradiated cats have 18 half-lives.
it's funny, now that you ask I can tell you all about the capital, but I really haven't got any idea about rivet city itself.
it's going to cause me some severe mental traumalater.
it's great to see the democratic process at work.
it's hard to tell where everything is, but it's always that way with one's insides, isn't it?
it's important workbecausewell, it just is.
it's in the center of town.
it's irrelevantin the short term, the legion is still monster enough that defeating it will make me look powerful indeed.
it's just about time to get you some news.
it's kind of embarrassing reallyonce a year, bob decides he's going to go ahead and start growing these weird pods filled with tiny seeds.
it's more complicated than thatthe chairmen share what you might call a beat tribal affinity.
it's most likely filled with toxins from the ventsso hug the wall, make as much space between you and the door or it's cloud nine in a casketor it's curtains for you.
it's no more than two and a half feet tall and two feet wideif you find it, you should be able to roll it up carefully.
it's not healthy to ask the wrong question, compadrethey have all the answers they want you to hearpeople who ask the wrong questions, or people who screw up, well, they don't stay around here very long.
it's not very efficient, though, but hopefully we'll be able to start running larger caravans once things get civilized.
it's obvious that the brotherhood has a base in hidden valley or thereaboutsfinding it won't be easy, but getting inside will be the real trick.
it's okay, I have a pass.
it's okay, I work here.
it's one of just two places on earth that have the hardware necessary to read the platinum chip - the lucky 38 is the other, of course.
it's people like you who will cause the name america to fade from memorychildren will think of the u.s.aas just the wasteland.
it's right here, stapled to the front of my gun.
it's safei hoperight now, let's focus on getting everyone emph else to safety, all right? everybody else all right?
it's standard pay caps to start, another  when the job is donewill you do it?
it's through the cloud - but if i'm with you, I can help you through itto himself, the player better not have if you didn't already force the lock to the gate, that is.
it's understandable that you'd be curious about this topic, but we'll hold off until the platinum chip has been recovered.
it's your time, and if you want to spend it chatting, not much I can do about it.

narration not long after the courier left the villa, the lights in the theater shut off, one by one.
narration obsession is another form of greed, a lesson that christine never learnedthis plays if christine diedeven though narrating, slightly judgmental and sad at the same time, as if shaking head.
narration once he left the theater, the sierra madre recognized him as a guest, and many doors opened to himhe had to admit, it had been built to last2nd part of this, slightly impressed.
narration only dean's hologram remained on stage, singing silently to an empty room.
narration over time, the ghost people came to see her as one of the hologramsthey would watch, silently, as she walked among them.

narration shrugging it off, his mind turned instead to where the courier had come fromvegas still survived, out there in the mojavedirection: whatever, throw the line away, then make it eager-new-horizons in second half.
narration the courier reminded her of the slight emph other courier she had met in the big empty, and wondered if the two had found each other at lastbig empty is a location in fallout.
narration the heist he spent over two hundred years planning fell apart, just as the first, by underestimating his partner's strength.
narration, a little tender hereat times, christine thought of the courier, who had kept elijah's hand from her throat.

ncr correctional facility is now under prisoner control following a successful riotlocals should avoid anyone who looks like they've done time.
ncr forces were permitted to occupy hoover dam and establish a military base at mccarran airportnot an airport anymore well, it used to be one.
ncr has failed to retake the prison it recently lost in a deadly riotpowder gang operations against the ncr are expected to continue.
ncr officials at camp mccarran were relieved when technical difficulties with its monorail line to the new vegas strip proved easy to fix.
ncr rangers are being pulled off the front lines as part of a campaign to "secure existing ncr territory," according to anonymous sources.
ncr reputation terrible unfortunately, I can't use you to protect kimballthe ncr won't let you come within a thousand feet of the president.
ncr sources say that holding the dam against caesar's legion has become their main strategic priority, and this move would not be unexpected.
near as I can tell, we age slower than youa lot slowerthere are even a few ghouls that were alive during the war.
need anything else?
need some help here and that audience is emph not looking friendly.
need something already.
negotiating an allotment of power from hoover dam was crucialthat's what's powered the strip for the past seven years.
neither have iwell, I mean I talk to herbert, but he never really says anything back.
nervous look just get rid of them, all right? tried to slip off stage, then they all started changing color and raising their hands emphnot a good sign<dean pleads to be rescued from the theater's hologramshe vanishes into the stage's scaffolding/hallways to hide away from them - holograms are on>
never going back and elijah was on his way here, so I couldn't stop to see if it was something I could fix

no cause for alarm - you'll have an escort of securitrons to help you fight your way onto the dam.
no entry without ticketsplease present your tickets.
no ghoul likes to be called a zombie, but crowley was going up to humans and almost daring them to do it.
no ideaa courierwore an old world flag on his backhe was the one who pulled me out there, told me where elijah had gone.
no kidding.
no looks like a emph rooftop in puesta del solin better days, nice viewnow? it's the last place anyone wants to stand when this event goes offcorrecting player, then takes a breath - this isn't good news.
no no no, you'll want to hear this out
no no, no i'm not leaving this spotwhy dirty my hands when the sierra madre can kill you for me?
no now now I think ruining you and all your plans would be enough for mekill me, I still win, you're never getting in the vault.
no one knows for certain, but the packs seem to be coming from the northeast.

no! that would be wrong!
no, honestly, I come from a vault!
no, I already have enough inventory items..i'd rather have some information instead
no, I suppose you aren'tmy mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
no, i'm notand I want a piece of the action.
no, i'm noti'm going to see that you pay for your crime.
no, just stupid.
no, mani know exactly what i'm doingi just don't know what effect it's going to have.

no, the place'll close up tighter than an opening at the frondsto himself or danny parker's sphincter when he has to tip a doormanfronds = old world casino, danny parker = old world entertainer that domino didn't like too much.
no, they greatly prefer the sort of technology that emphasis puts people in hospitalsor graves, rather, since hospitals went the way of the dodo.
no, you haven't.
no, you want to know why? because there's more beneath the streets, in the buildings, and oh - everywhere else.
no, you're notreally.
no.
nobody except me. why would the people need anyone else but dave? I give them all that they ask for.
nobody's gonna do this to me!
nods all rightbeat just glad I can emph answer you now.
nods all rightcold, she knows she may be trapping the player down here if you go down there, are you prepared what if you don't come back? christine is asking, because she knows that elijah will show up, and when he does, she's going to suicide and kill him.
nods like dancing with your shadow.
nods, but slight worry don't be long.
nods, sighs I takes a breath never mindlet me get the vault open to herself, slowly, quiet as if memorizing it "begin again but know when to let go." slight rueful laugh, to playersounds like yousay this a little tenderly, the player just talked her down from suicide, and christine's found new purpose.
nods, totally lying i'll be sure to cover you, don't you worry.
nofrom what i've heard, a while back a group of merchants seized control of the water tower and proclaimed that they were the water merchants and people had to get water from themthe merchant war raged on for years until a man named roy greene - yeah, justin's grandfather, that's it - helped to negotiate an agreement that ended the war.
non-combatants are advised to stand clear of weapons discharge.
none of your business, pal.
nonplussed and why would you have done that?
nonplussed you have?
nonplussed you have? so you have the means to gain entry?
nope 
nope, not gonna tell ya.
nopeain't gonna part with thatperiodit's genuine pre-war memorabiliaa little slice of historyno way
nopecan't say that I heard anything but them 'lurks in quite some time.
nopehad a pretty good claim once, way out east by the river, but got run off by raiderseventually, got too old to keep going out.
noplease get your payment and leave.
nor have I any interest in being worshipped as some kind of machine god messiahi am impervious to such corrupting ambitions.
normals cannot carry weapons here! halt and identify yourself!
not all technology, mind youyou don't see them raiding hospitals to cart away auto-docs or armfuls of prosthetic organs.
not believing the player for a moment, then getting nervous
not buying it oh, come now - don't play the foolvegas has fools enough, a superfluity of themthey're what makes it so profitable.
not buying it this is no time to be droll
not drunk enough .
not enough bullets in the town to spend on themso unless you're a real good shot, save one for yourself right before they catch you.
not even for   chips? 
not even his own family knows it. he goes up to the water treatment plant at night to get high... I dunno... I can't reach him. maybe you can.
not going to deny it yes, of coursebut refraining from those "dietary practices" is a primary requirement of their contract.
not happy, but sees an opportunity what are you waiting for? rubbing it in? slight disgust/eager strike up the band alreadyaudio: from a speaker.
not hardly. we've got our mission, we'll stick with it, and to hell with lyons and his soldier sycophants.
not if you've been invitedyou realize that you've made quite a splash here in new vegas?
not interested? louder not interested?
not just against caesar's legion, by the wayin fact, the ncr is a more present and insidious threat.
not leaving me much choicethe fountain, huh? beat hope the hologram's still working and the battery's running strong.
not like anyone around here ever buys anything from that shop of hers.
not much help against the ghosts, still, if you're about to give up, call it quits? beat, punchlinethrow it to emph me so I can eat a bullet first.
not much to live off of around here, except salvage from that factoryif they made off with anything expensive, we'd be hurting something fierce.
not much to tella brahmin or two loaded up with weapons, and a whole mess of well-armed guards to make sure it ends up where it's supposed to.
not on my watch, it isn'ti'm here to put an end to you and your kind.
not one for fighting if we can avoid itstill, wasn't bad at the pistol range and over the years, i've learned how to handle a knife
not particularly.
not quite as good as that vault stuff you're used to, but it'll do you.
not really happy to hear this, it's like someone left his door unlocked in a dangerous neighborhood oh, looks like you already forced the gatebeat, under his breath now, everybody and their mother can walk right in, thanks.
not right now.
not so eager to take on a suicide mission, is that it? if you'd shown moderation in your dealings with the ncr, we wouldn't be in this position.
not so loud! I don't need you saying that all over the hub
not surprisingalso not acceptable.
not that I have anything to worry about. the people know who their leader is in this republic.
not today, thanks
not unkindly in any case this is an employer - employee relationshipi've given you an assignment, and the directions are clear.
not very bright, are you?
not very sporting of you.
not yet. rosie still hasn't voted.
nothing but the highest quality leftovers, junk, and crap!
nothing else matters? hell no! I wanna hear about the dying part!
nothing for me right nowi'm on a diet.
nothing I can think ofnow if you'll excuse me, I have a business to run.
nothing I mean, i'm taking care of the brahmin.
nothing important as you and meunfortunately, this is the worst place on earth to experience what ton does besttoo many zombies cramp my stylei'll let you know when I think about some place more convenient .
nothing personal.
nothing that wouldn't be wrong with any man who loses a wife, I supposepoor dear.
nothing to impede progressif you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows.
nothing too bad yetbut he's always worrying we'll lose air filtration or whatever.
nothing, bye.
nothing, really, I was just leaving.
nothing, sorry.
nothing, thanks.
nothing.
nothingbye.
nothingcan I ask you some more questions?
nothingsorry to bring it upnow is there anything else I can do for you?
now all we need is a gang, and we could take over this whole wasteland!
now don't get crazy on me and start wearing branches
now go away and never come back!
now how exactly am I supposed to do that? I can barely move anymore.
now i'm going to have to do the same to you.
now it's just a matter of adjusting the attitudes of some lesser groups while we wait for caesar's legion to attack hoover dam.
now next time, try to be where the bullets aren't.
now that's a delivery service you can count on.
now there's someone you don't ever want to mess with, he scares mehe 'owns' the maltese falcon.
now we're supplying grunts, mercs, and anybody else on our sidewe don't make much but at least we're saving lives.
now you're starting to piss me off.
now's not really the time for that, is it?
now, are you applying for citizenship, asylum, or just vacationing in the republic of dave?
now, because of your carelessness, benny has fled the strip, taking with him the platinum chip.
now, do you want something to eat?
now, get away from me, smoothskinif moriarty even suspects I told you this, i'm a dead ghoul.
now, if you'll excuse me
now, take your time, breathe slowly, sight down the barrel, and squeeze the trigger.
now, what odds and ends can i, the craziest of all possible wolfgangs offer to you?
now, will you hear me out? if not, we don't have much more to talk about.
now, you know I hate repeating myself. damn stupid idea.
now... where did I put that scalpel? ah! there it is...

obviously, I miscalculated his drive for supremacybut in any case, you've come along - a more-than-suitable replacement.
obviously, you already know that i'm goneit was something I needed to doyou're an adult nowyou're ready to be on your own.
odd man out dead weightsomeone you need holding the toolbox, the nurse passing the scalpel, the chauffer driving you to the concert.
odds are that caesar will launch his assault on the dam after kimball's visit is concluded, one way or the other - so be on guard.
odds are they were vault dwellersthat's everything I know about them, really.
of all the wastelanders I had to bump into it has to be one with a conscienceto self annoyed
of course I am
of course I voted. I was the first to vote. now i'm just waiting for the rest of the votes to come in.
of course it would. I knew that. you heard me say that before, didn't you. it was my idea after all. here, take it.
of course noti'm here to kill you!
of course you can, don't be silly.
of course you cani'm not always going to be here to take care of youyou're going to have to learn to fend for yourself.

of course, child.
of course, I will reward youbring her and you will receive  in hub scriptwill you help me?
of course, if that happened guess we'd all have to leave the vault then, huh? impishly pleased with the idea.
of course, of course. I should have you killed, but that would be boring. {first part is said dismissively and condescendingly}
of course, with a face like ground brahmin meat, you can imagine that folks don't take too kindly to us.
of course, you could just aim for the heada good headshot will do a lot of damage to most anything.
of course. as president of the republic, I have a mandate to repopulate the wasteland.
of coursei know this is an unusual request, but hey, i'm an unusual treewell, bob is anyway
of coursewhat, some kind of surprise to you that I knew people once? used to have my name in lights, all right?

oh, and before you go - grab that print-out spooling from the console here - those papers set the terms for the ncr's unconditional surrender.
oh, by all means - yesthat's refreshing.
oh, come onwhat? annoyed by the delay
oh, don't be coyyou've been playing a high-stakes game ever since victor dug you out of the grounddon't be afraid to admit it.

sigh of impatience - oh, the burden of intelligence the platinum chip unlocks this bunkerhence, you have it.
sigh of impatience - oh, the burdens of intelligence that you were searched very thoroughly when you arrived at the fort is a certaintyand as the chip is a little too large to be beat, implying hiding it up rectumsecreted away
sigh of pique but you still wound up here, right where I wanted youself-satisfied I knew I could rely on caesar to return the platinum chip to you.

since you brought my tandi back to me, things are quite finemy eternal gratitude to you, wanderer.
sinclair built this whole town to accommodate hersame with the casino's voice lockhe wanted to make sure she had access to everything.
sinclair made sure if you spent money here, it went emph one direction - although that's not how emph he described it.
sinclair must have known, thoughhe was dense, not in that waybut that doesn't make any senseif she was sick, dying
sinclair was already puppy-eyed, so all I had to do was the introductionsdisgusted she smiled, fluttered her eyes, showed a little leg
sing-song, then disdainful in second half and i'm not stabbing you in the backi was facing you all the timethis heist? I planned it lifetimes agoyou and that old man? tourists.
singlehandedly destroying a brotherhood of steel bunker is quite an accomplishmentplatoons of ncr troops have died, trying to do the same.
singlehandedly, you've brought mankind's best hopes of forward progress crashing downno punishment would be too severe.
sit and dream
skeptical it's possiblethis place is immense and it still has power, food dispensers, security was it all for pre-war guests? beat or for her?
skeptical well "safely?" around here, that word doesn't come cheap.
slight exasperation, as if he's thought about this a lot, then tries to recall hamlet quotefriend "there's more mysteries in heaven and earth" wait, no, "there is more between heaven and earth" oh, forget it.
slight frustration no they run a lot deeper than that.
slight hesitation all right look, if the holograms are here to keep me company, then I don't mind staying here for a while.
slight irriation sure, let's jaw all day and all night, why not?
slight irritation finewarning player I hear my collar beeping though, i've got the route to the exit all mapped out.
slight irritation of course you dolet's hear 'em.
slight nervous no idea woke up here, thought I was dreaming for a second right back on stage, the mic thinking about to the show days
slight nervous you are preaching to the choirsinclair and his security don't even get me startedthose holograms being slightly casual in his speech here, even though his life is in danger.
slight surprise surprised that super mutant didn't eat you under her breath and don't get me started on dean.
slight surprise the clinic? beat, a little waryyeah, I did bring her inbefore the gala well, before the first gala eventa few lifetimes agodean's initially worried he's been "caught" at the opening of this thread, then recovers, tries to dismiss it.
slight surprise, confused what? what are you talking about?
slight surprise, hasn't given a lot of thought to this in a long time problem? all high-and-mightylording it over everyoneacting so self-righteous, like nothing could touch himhe was the one with the problem.
slight upbeat at the end, different than the eeriness forecast: cloudy, with a chance of friendshipspoken in an eerie whisper, prophetic, like clay's telling a fortunehe's really not, he's just compiling a bunch of images.
slightly defensive, angry, echoing player's "stupid" accusation stupid? no, playing it smartemph you're the dumb one, waltzing in here without realizing who the headliner is<dean bids farewell to the playerthe trap springs, and he retreats to the stage's scaffolding/hallways to avoid harm - holograms are on>
slightly friendlier, let's-make-a-deal good, good - then we're in businessi may be a betting man, but I like it when the odds are in our favor.
slightly impressed looks like you got almost everything, not much more emph I can extract slight smile"doctor." not mocking at the end, she's impressed, means "doctor" as a casual compliment.
slightly irritated, still superior now, now that's emph my roomyou want your own dressing room, you have to work for itdean admonishes, cynically, player when he/she goes into dean's old dressing room in the backstage of the theater
slightly predatory what no hug? come hereholotape recording, tense, dean's here to insure vera's cooperation in the heist.
slightly sad for a moment over the years, it kept climbing up out of the sierra madre, until it was curtains for the sundidn't see the sky again.
slightly uneasy, player is right we'll seei don't think you're gonna have the time.
slightly unnerved, player's about to break his last line of defense don't do itleave that projector alone - i'm warning youdean threatens pc to stop triggering the event that will disable his last line of defense against the player.
slightly wistful, quiet a little party favor before the grand finale.
slightly worried just get ready to run when you do I sure willto himself think the villa's bad now you haven't seen half the hell this town can raise.
slow bounce
slow, but I am making some progresscan I ask you a few more questions?
slow, reverent - this is quietly dramatic, ends on a sad downnote the divide, where the two messengers, the two couriers, fought beneath an ancient flag, at the edge of the worldslow, draw this to a closekeep this quietly dramaticthis is forecasting a horrible, tragic event to come in a future adventure.
slow, then challenging, bravado so you think you have what it takes to beat emph me, on emph my stage, in emph my town? come on down, we'll seedean challenges, in an act of desperation, the player to come down and hunt him.
slowly and he's going to use the gala event to open the casino? but thinking that's interesting.
small living pests.
smart choiceyou could stand to lose a few pounds.
smiles, nods 
smug i'm not a betting man, i've come too far to leave it to chance.
smug me, though, i'm a guest here, so I guess I got the royal treatment after all.
smug, a little eager time for a little show - i'll just grab a seat and watch how this plays out from backstagesecurity can handle it from here<dean bids farewell to the playerthe trap springs, and he retreats to the stage's scaffolding/hallways to avoid harm - holograms are on>
smug, confident no, i'm notemph i'll get out in time - you won'talready planning ahead, as if free and clear already once I kill you, exit stage left, and my collar will go quiet.
smug, dismissive way I figure it, you'll try and run for the exit, and only I know where the key is - and where the safest place in the whole theater is: backstage.
snaps fingers as music kicks in, ohhh yeahand that's more like it, got a beat you can swing tobeat and they won't set off your collar any more - lower, tougher just hit that guy where it hurts<audio: radio collardean succeeds in disabling the vault's security speakers.>

so - let's keep this sweet and polite, and finish our conversation with no misunderstandings.
so - what, you're heading to the main terminal now that you've got this floor unlocked?
so as long as we're "in this together," and it's a choice between you and me? I know what you're going to choose.
so be it, wandererseth will show you out.
so here's the short of it - piece together little miss vera keyes' song in the right order? beat, spreads hands sierra madre opens its legs, we're in business.
so here's to sweet, glorious freedom! cheers!
so I hooked up with a couple other vets bribed a gun runner
so if you're emph that good, don't aim for the head - aim for their bombsand if you can wait until his buddies are close by, even better.
so made the introductions, and guess what? he builds this place for her, like some kind of cleopatra obsessionbeat, looks aroundwasn't always a deathtrap.
so many things could have gone wrong, and there's really no telling how the overseer will react when he finds out.
so maybe you and I should have a little chat - just like we did when you first waltzed into town.
so much to do, so little time to do itmildly sarcastic
so near? far? come on, make up your mind! frustrated and a little confused
so no, I don't think you'll shut them offyou don't threaten people, not your way.
so that's it then?
so the followers are a problem?
so unless you have an actual medical problem, maybe you could stop distracting me from my work.
so we go together, or we're not going at alli'll split my hand in blackjack when the time's right, i'm not splitting up in this town, trust me.
so we gonna play again or what? c'mon, montei'm just getting started
so what are you doing here? return to the fort at once.
so what do you want me to do?
so what's the spear for?
so what's your story, beautiful?
so why don't you hear emph my proposal first, before you start talking about what emph you need.
so you don't want to share keep her from me, huh? all we have to do is make her sing, and it's all ours.
so you leaving me here? no dice, not going to happen, and nothing you can say will change my mind.
so you were sent to plunder the treasury?
so you'd need to do a full circuit of the corridor to get to itonce there, you'll need to shut it down, and I don't have the code.
so you've said beforeyou're making a habit of wasting my time.
so, find the music, get it to the projector room upstairs, then play it? might reset security, worth a shot.
so, have you decided to become a part of history and triumphantly return with the declaration of independence in hand?
so, here's to freedom and rocking the wasteland! drink up!
so, it looks like you decided to do things their wayhow come?
so, they really need me that badly, huh? I guess I never thought of it that wayawfully selfish of me.
so, what do you think? want to give it a try?
so, you need to get to class and take your g.o.a.texamno excuses.

these plants aren't just harmful to the gardenthey also have the ability to attack humans and other creatures
these plants of dark soul are an odd mutationit is doubtful that they mutated this way as a result of natural causes
these should sell well, thank you.
they are, shall we say, understating aggressively reclusive? they have several howitzers they fire at anyone who dares approach the base.
they asked me how well I understood theoretical physicsi said I had a theoretical degree in physicsthey said welcome aboard.
they asked me if I knew anything about power plantsi said as much as anyone i'd ever met.
they catch you, they drag you into the cloud, and you're not coming back outto himselfafter that, having your necktie go off would be mercy.
they come to vegas chasing penny-ante dreams of high-living, to feel like they're big shots, like they're winners.
they control the watergo to the south end of the merchant market, you'll find them there.
they could be lying or it could be part of their plan to make you believe them.
they could have programmed me to loveto forgivebut nnoooo talking to herself, frustrated that she has to kill someone
they don't bother you as much if you don't look like they might want to convert you.
they don't like to play hide and seek.
they encroachlet's leave it at that, shall we?
they have no idea what other cards i'm holdingit's a strong hand, believe me - I dealt it to myself.
they have those stinkies that pull them.
they hear anything out of the ordinary, especially "music" screaming through the speakers when I close the connection? they'll be here, fast.

they live in the heights, on barter street and thunder avenuecomplete the job and return.
they might still be around here though, if'n you think you can help 'em.
they mustered me out a year agoadministrative discharge.
they never retained personality once removed from the human body.
they occupied nellis air force base a little over 50 years agoone of my securitrons got some video of their arrival - and then exploded.
they recognized my sovereignty over the vegas strip and agreed to supply electricity and water once their engineers repaired the dam.
they reminded me of a certain criminal element vegas used to attracti told them some stories, gave them some clothes - and they ran with it.
they saw the shit I did for the ncr, how I carried them on my back, brought fire to the heathensi wasn't gonna help them but they begged.
they start weighing the odds, taking risks and then taking each other outbomb collars or not.
they steal from the merchants and give to the poor, or some such nonsensethey are inconsequential to methat old mutant, harold would know more.
they sure as shit didi mean there's still formalities, like I have to run everything by lawson before I do it.
they took pride in their crafti don't think omertas saw other people as people at alleveryone else was just prey.
they used to be whinersbut ton talks too muchyou get out of my face.
they used to control the hospital until the children took overnow they sit and brood in their warehouse - very strangeyou will find them at the northwest end of the merchant market.
they usually don't understand a word I say, but i'll make them come around.
they want me to make an omelet, but I can't break any of their eggs, know what i'm saying?
they were nomads, capable fighters, but their specialty was betrayalthey'd invite travelers into their yurts, drug them, murder or enslave them.
they weren't afraid of me, they were afraid of caesar - that attacking me would leave them vulnerable to a legion offensive.
they will pass right through an area known to be attacked by raidersthey charge a lot so they can hire extra handsthe pay's great but you have to be alive to spend it, right?
they won't listen to me at allif I tell them something simple, then it gets doneotherwise, birch spends a week looking for a hidden meaning.

they're a terrorist group, basicallymilitant, quasi-religious fanatics obsessed with hoarding pre-war technology.
they're cowardsthey set ambushes against our patrolsthey send spies and saboteursthey know they can't win a real fightthe master says we should feel sorry for them, but ton just want to kill themsmart man, ton.
they're in charge of all the watergreedy people, I wouldn't want to work for themtheir pay is the worst and the jobs are just as bad.
they're missing caravans too?
they're not supposed to be saving a bunch of backwards locals from raiders, they're supposed to be saving mankind from a new dark age.
they're pretty easy to killmore a nuisance than anything else.
they're slavers, led by a guy named see-zer caesaror less certainly, kai-zar caesarnot sure how you're supposed to say it.
they're the last of the merchants, and I mean that literallysmall time stuff, mostlylook northeast of the merchant market.
they've been a blessing.
they've been good to their wordput together one hell of a resort hotel, too.
thing is, when the recording queued up, a nice, calm, appreciative audience appeared in the theater - no security with their head-blasting zap rays.
things are much more settled nowrazlo has been working on a cure for rad scorpion poison, and with that, we should be able to fight what's left of them.
think about it, mandown here, i'll always be stuck with the same job, with the same food, with the same people, forever.
think you can take charge of the gang by getting rid of me?
think you're going to up-stage me, here at the sierra madre? I don't think sonow that i'm inside well, I don't need you anymore.
thinking hurts you, too? aw, I wish I could let you have the one on my head but I can'tit hurts real bad when I don't wear it.
thinking no, that I still had to figure out - still dosinclair wrote stuff down, was obsessive about itjust got to find where.
thinking that means we'll still need a copy of the song to get into the vault and after all I went through to smuggle a copy inside.
thinking the med-x and superstimsand here I thought she was trying to numb herself to the lights.
thinking you powered the holograms up? beat well yeah, that's pretty good protectionto himself sure worked at the fountain, vera kept the ghost people away.

those people you killed were some of the most peaceful people in the wasteland!
those rockets over at repconn were the ncr's doingtrying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.
those were our top stories.
those who can afford passports are saying the added security is well worth the price of admission.
those who claim to have dined at the restaurant find the food appealing but say many tables remain empty.
though novac eventually fell to the legion, many citizens of novac were able to escape, alive and intact.

towns like goodsprings and primm don't stay independent for long, not if you've got something the ncr wantsstill, the ncr keeps the legion away.
trade routes, my friend, trade routesjust about every major town in the wasteland has a crimson caravan branch in it.
trade up front. no exceptions. especially not for junkies.
traders from california are being turned away at mojave outpost, where the ncr is concerned about dangers along nipton highway and i-15.

travelers are advised not to make friendly chit-chat with them.
tried talking to them, bribing them, leaving food - nothingin the years since, they haven't changed their approach, but I sure have.
trouble is, most of the controls for this place aren't here - they're in the tower.
troubling news from primm as merchants report a large presence of armed, unsavory figures patrolling the townresidents are nowhere to be found.
truetour guides would be much nicer.
trust me - as soon as you can, run to the door to the emph left - use the key you got out of the music rag there, and camp out.

uneasy but, uh how do I know the power won't suddenly go out? and I don't know, this still sounds risky to meemph for me.
uneasy look those ghosts are going to come out of the wings behind you in a second, the security types, emph not the "friendly" bald types.
uneasy no, you belong out in the audience I mean, not like uh you could get backstagethat key you snagged, it won't work.
uneasy sure does like to make a presentation wish he'd keep it down, or else the ghost people are going to swarm the gates, vera hologram or no.

was that meant to be a shocking revelation? of course caesar wants it destroyed - he's afraid of what the bunker might hold, and rightly so.
was that really necessary?
wasteland critters like to move in when sunny's not looking, so watch out.

we know their value better than any junk-trader, and we've got more ammo stores, so you can expect a better trade for the tech.
we may be the best-equipped people in the world, but we've still only got so many people out there looking to recover the past's technology.
we must've done something right for you to come along like you did.

when asked why, the source said someone alerted them to the fact that caesar's legion was comprised of, quote, a bunch of squares.
when he alerted me, I instructed him to approach the site after benny and the others had departed.
when I saw you coming towards oasis, I thought I felt that you'd understand mei guess I was wrong.
when I started studying medicine, one of the first things I learned was how to spot a kid playing sick to get out of taking a test.
when pay day hits, i'm off to the stripcan't wait.
when she became pregnant, it was the happiest I had ever seen herahhhhshe had great things in mind for you.
when the feral ghouls killed tara, dukov realized that he would get more of the commission.
when we first met, I thought I recognized the collar technologyjust needed some time to experiment with it.
when we get the word, we go out and kill peoplepeople like the followers or some of the more dangerous gang types.
when you become one of us, you will not fear such minor thingsbegone.
when you bring the chip to me, I will pay you four times the delivery bonus stipulated in your contracthow's that?
when you return topside, I think you'll see that my securitron army is a little more than the legion was prepared to handle.
where are your parents?
where can I find this merchant?
where can I get some supplies?
where did I put my lighter? 
where did you come from?
where have you been all my life?
where is this bastard? i'll kill him.

while it initially appeared to be an ncr victory, we're receiving word that our own mrhouse may have been the one to secure the dam for himself.
while the destruction of the repconn rockets appeared to be a boon to the salvagers of novac, the benefit would never be realized.
whispering thing is, here's where being my emph partner pays offsee, I know how to get into the casino vault.
whistles softly, appreciating now, emphthere's a viewto casino hello, beautiful<stepping out onto the roof with the view of the sierra madre, dean makes a comment about the view>
who are the brotherhood?
who are you?
who believes in that bullshit? they have to program these morons to believe in that stuff anyway.
who is mostly interested in selling equipment and information.
who is this master?
who knows? who cares? I get to eat well, sleep in peace and kill some of the people who used to screw me overyou want something more from life?
who needs the word? why not just kill them?
who or what are you?
who sent you?
who the hell are you? they bring you in to replace me? they're replacing me, aren't they?
who the hell knows? maybe it's just morpheus pulling the stringsthings are good, and if this dries up, ton goes somewhere else.
who's in charge here?
who's in charge of the water merchants?
whoa, hey, that's cool and all, but you're just a little too intense, y'know?
whoa, heyall right, manit's coolwho said anything about being your master?
whoa, really? ho, shit! I knew I could do itthose ncr pricks can all get on their knees and worship at the altar of fucking fantastic!
whoa-ho! check out the brain on this guy!
whoa. the doctor is in.
whoops, better put on my newsman fedora, here.
whwhat! oh, I see, you're joking
why are you so carved up - frowns, a little incredulous that a emph bear trap on your arm?
why did you say it like that? he 'owns' the maltese falcon.
why didn't emphasis victor intervene sooner, you mean?
why do I get all the hoodlums?
why do you keep jumping between first and third person?

why don't you give me some info?  
why don't you give me some info?  ,  ,  
why don't you give me some information?

why don't you think it's the water merchants?
why dont bother primm anymore.
why hello again, aren't we looking handsome today?
why hello! it's nice to see you againwhat can I do for you today?
why in the world did you attack president kimball?
why stay here and be stuck as a barber for my entire life when I could go out there and make my own choices?
why sure, i'd be happy to helpwhat did you need to know?
why would he want to torture me? more to herself if he wanted to do that, he could keep his singing career going or keep staring at me.
why would I need luck?
why would I want to go to war against the ncr? they're my best customers.
why would I want to talk with someone who goes around killing kids? get out of my face!
why would it happen to the far go traders more than the others? 
why would you keep people from getting in the jail?
why would you want a brahmin? do you have a caravan? well, it doesn't matteri only take care of themdan is the one that owns them; he won't sell them though.
why you manipulative bitch! nobody screws with ton like that!
why, of course I do!
why, yes! your knowledge of american history is quite impressive!
why, you don't know? whispering I heard that they make human sacrifices and do all sorts of other terrible things!
why?
why? survivali still needed to leave the residential area to scrounge up supplies, and I don't like taking chances.
will you ensure that president kimball survives his visit to hoover dam?
wimpier than ghouls.
wimpy things.
with all that money pouring in? give me 20 years, and i'll reignite the high technology development sectors50 years, and i'll have people in orbit.
with all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
with caesar dead, it's hard to know what to expectthe legate, lanius, is renowned as a brutal man, not a subtle tactician.
with no other communities coming to its defense, novac would eventually fall to the legion's persistent attacks.
with only one key, there's no point in my going back.
with regret comes a girl smiling sad, brown robe, name veronica, half herewraps her and her heart up like a pack, in the pack, a key, some sayspoken in an eerie whisper, prophetic, like clay's telling a fortunehe's really not, he's just compiling a bunch of images.
with the feuding couple in broken hills, the wife really did throw the cat's paw in the trash.
with this accomplished, all preparations will have been madethe battle for hoover dam will be upon us before long.
without a doubt.
without you we'd be in a lot worse shape.
witness descriptions are remarkably similar to accounts of the goodsprings courier who, as we reported, recently survived a gunshot to the head.
witnesses report a huge object or creature surfacing in lake meadso far, photos of the so-called lake mead monster are grainy and underexposed.
woman
won't be a problemwe have plenty of spice traders working with us back home, and we could get meat from local brahmin ranchers.
wonder what happened to the suckersfrowns might have gotten taken away, like I did?
word of advice, though: if you ever catch up with him, watch outthe man's got cold eyes like a snakecan't be trusted, i'd say.
word out of camp golf is that many ncr rangers can expect redeployment in the near futureone anonymous soldier said it was part of a new strategy.
working on a computer, trying to shut it downhnhmaybe I can shut down these ghosts using the stage manager's old termin blows updammit! beat, frowns well, so much for that ideadean curses, insulting old stage manager's computer (backstage), after blows up when tried to disable hologramspc's only chance to escape alive.
worried? do I look worried to you? i've got this under control, babyno one else can do what I do herein denial.
would kimball and oliver have traded the lives of hundreds of soldiers for absolute control of hoover dam? oh yes.
would you consider taking him a personal item, like this key, and just telling him you killed me?
would you please kill me?
would you stop screwing around?
would you want to miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime?
wow! do you know where it is?
wow! I can live on this for the rest of my life! thanks a lot, ma'am!
wow! I can live on this for the rest of my life! thanks a lot, mister!
