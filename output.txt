Not much to tell. A brahmin or two loaded up with weapons, and a whole mess of well-armed guards to make sure it ends up where it's supposed to.
One nifty bit, though. The gun cases are rigged to explode. So trying to loot one of our caravans doesn't do much good.
And that's how the NCR stays equipped. The only thing we don't bring in is energy weapons.
The Gun Runners have been putting rapid-fire death-dealing in the hands of anyone who needed to defend himself for over a century.
We're the NCR's #1 supplier of weapons and ammunition. You might call us an unofficial branch of the army.
I'm a salesman. I swing through McCarran and the dam once a week or so to take orders. But lately I spend most of my time in this piss heap.
Ever since the 15 shut down, all caravans come through here - right to me. I check the stock and direct deliveries onward to meet orders.
Sure, it stinks to hang out here, but it won't be forever. Plus I can afford a monthly bender on the Strip and still build up my nest egg.
Am I selling? Yeah. Am I selling to you? No. Sorry to hurt your feelings, but you're small time. Move along.
There's usually a gun merchant hanging around topside. I'm sure she'll take care of you.
Like you have a clue what that even means. {scoffing}
We used to. But every caravan carrying them was getting ambushed and wiped out. By someone sophisticated enough to know which was which.
We think it was the Brotherhood of Steel - those crazies always go hard for energy weapons. But the NCR would rather pretend they killed all of them.
Still plenty of other problems keeping the 15 shut down, though. Thanks for playing.
That'll help. Still plenty of problems out that way, though.
You took out a Deathclaw nest? Either you're lying, or you're tougher than you look.
Still plenty of troubles out that way, though. Thanks for playing.
That's impressive - if you're telling the truth.
Still, it'll take some time for routes to readjust. I expect I'll be working from here for the foreseeable future.
[SUCCEEDED] You might be on to something. I like to hang on to any weapons mods I run across...
Take a look.
[FAILED] Do I look like a fucking arms caravan to you?
Do you think the Gun Runners keep the NCR military supplied by carrying weapons and ammo from the Boneyard out here by the armload?
Get a clue. We have caravans. We deal in bulk.
Take a look.
You like it any better if I tell you to fuck off?
Is there some reason I should be talking to you? {disdaining}
Still making a nuisance of yourself?
You hear the losers around here complaining how they lost their shirts on the Strip? It's pathetic.
After I win big, I'm going to buy my friends dinner at that fancy Gor-mant restaurant. I saw ads for it back home.
I walked all the way from Hub! Thought I'd rest my feet here a day or two, then I head onto the Strip fresh.
I'll get in, win big, get out. Take those winnings back home where they'll do some good!
You know it's illegal for us to gamble back home? The government wants to keep us poor.
I'm sick of the sob stories you hear around here. If you don't know when to stop gambling, that's no one's fault but your own.
I can't wait to see the Strip. I hear it's so beautiful!
Oh, you could. You just don't want to.
I understand. Sorry to be a bother.
But... Of course. It's all right. Thank you.
Thank you so much! I'm so hungry!
Sorry I had to bother you. I've... well, I've lost everything.
You're very kind. I wish... well, I'll just thank you and leave you be.
I lost everything I had at The Tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, I'd head straight back. Sick, huh?
I came east to strike it rich, and now I'm broker than ever. What do I tell my family back home?
On the Strip, everyone's nice to you when you got the caps. The moment you don't? They throw your ass out.
I won big my first night on the Strip. I kept chasing that feeling. Right into the gutter.
I sat down at a roulette table with my life savings. An hour later, it was gone.
Can you spare some caps, mister?
Can you spare some caps, 'mam?
Go East! they say. Scrap lying in the sun for you to grab. Yeah, right.
The Strip ain't nothing but a monster. Chews folks up, sucks out their caps, and spits 'em back out.
Oh, I don't sell things, mister. I sell thoughts.
Oh, I don't sell things, ma'am. I sell thoughts.
That's not junk. That's other people's thoughts. People had to think to make them, and the thoughts got stuck inside.
I need other people's thoughts to fill my head when I'm not thinking myself. Otherwise it's... kind of empty.
Thinking hurts you, too? Aw, I wish I could let you have the one on my head but I can't. It hurts real bad when I don't wear it.
This thing on my head is headache medicine. It works real good, except I can't think when it's on. {emphasize} Really think, I mean.
I don't have a mama or papa anymore. I see them sometimes when I take off my medicine, but they can't stay. I'm pretty used to being on my own.
Great! What do you want me to think about? I can think about You, Here... or Everywhere. What do you want?
Sure, I could do some more thinking. What should I do my thinking about this time?
That's all right, mister. You will someday.
That's all right, ma'am. You will someday.
Sorry, sir. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
Sorry, ma'am. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
I can take off my medicine and do some thinking. People say it's real interesting. I don't know, {'cause} because I never hear it.
Some people say that it's a gift. Other people say that it's the kind of thinking anyone could do if they watched more than they talked.
I don't know which is true. I see a lot, I think a lot. There's a lot to hear through the 188, too, that maybe accounts for the thinking.
Let me take off my medicine...
Bull and Bear over the Dam, at each other's throats... but a light from Vegas? Ball spinning on the wheel, more than two at the table, placing bets. 
All lose in different ways, a dam of corpses, towns of corpses, scattered across the sand. But whose, in what shares? Even the dealer doesn't know. 
Forecast: A rain of blood will flood the desert and not purify it.
Bleh. Thinking about Everywhere always makes me feel a little sick...
I thought you'd say that.
Oh, I don't know anything, mister. I just think it, and then I don't.
Oh, I don't know anything, ma'am. I just think it, and then I don't.
Okay. Let me take off my medicine...
{A little slower, more thoughtful} Your face does the thinking - two to the skull, yet one gets up. Odds are against you... but they're just numbers after the two-to-one.
You're playing the hand you've been dealt, but you don't let it rest, you shuffle and stack, and a gamble... a gamble that may pay off? {Frowns} But how?
Forecast: Rapidly changing conditions.
{Frowns, resumes normal voice} A lot of thinking - most of it in your face, it's almost shouting at me. {Beat, slight apology} Sorry if I said anything weird.
I need to take off my medicine...
Local, local, the here and now... little of interest... things to buy, false hopes, and regrets watered down, washed down in dirty glasses.
With regret comes a girl... smiling sad, brown robe, name Veronica, half here. Wraps her and her heart up like a pack, in the pack, a key, some say. 
{Slight upbeat at the end, different than the eeriness} Forecast: Cloudy, with a chance of friendship. 
{Frowns, winces} Ouch. Thinking small only hurts a little, but it's a sharp pain.
Hi, mister. I hope you're doing fine today.
Hello, ma'am. I hope you're doing fine today.
I thought I'd be seeing you again.
This job's boring enough without talking to you. Go see Alexander.
Alexander doesn't pay me to talk.
I only work for caravans, all right? Try someone else.
Sitting around here makes me miss my raider days. I don't know why I figured it was time to get respectable.
Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying.
I don't work for freelancers. So move along.
Stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours, got it?
There's more to the 188 than meets the eye. Troops move back and forth on 93 all the time, and 95 is how NCR folks come and go from Vegas.
No shortage of customers... so long as Legion raids south of here don't get worse, anyways.
Not much. I hear some folks got killed down by Nelson... or was it Novac? I don't know. If they come up this way, me and dad'll go someplace else.
Name's Michelle. My Dad and me run this store. His name's Samuel. I take the day shift and he takes nights.
We came here about a month ago, when Primm went to hell on account of the prison break north of there. Found a bin to call home and set up shop.
That's nice. I suspect we'll stick around here, though. Business has been good.
Have a look.
You do know these old roads were numbered, right? We're standing where the 95 and 93 meet. And 95 plus 93 equals... 188.
Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. How can I help you?
Back for more?
You a merc? 'Cause you don't look like a prospector...
I've still got guns and ammo, if you need them.
Hell, yes sir. Well... not officially. Not anymore. 
They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
Hell, yes ma'am. Well... not officially. Not anymore. 
They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
Sure do. Lots of folk been coming out east, sorting through junk, looking for whatever they can sell.
Times are tough back home. Too many people, not enough work. Unless you like shoveling brahmin shit.
It means my C.O. was an asshole, and I told him to eat shit. He ordered me to flog a couple "deserters."
Those kids didn't desert. They just got liquored up on the Strip and missed roll call.
I don't know what else the brass expects... half these kids don't get more than two weeks of training before they ship 'em out here.
Staff sergeant, Third Platoon, Bravo Company. I was at the Dam when the Legion hit us, three years back. {Proud of her service}
That was a shitstorm, and don't let anybody tell you different. The brass try to play it down, but most of them were back at McCarran.
Going home didn't feel right, not with those savages camped on the other side of the river, sharpening their knives.
And I still get to see my old platoon when they pass through here... make sure the new C.O. is treating them right, and sneak them extra ammo.
Anyway, I was always complaining about the standard issue gear. The new kids don't even get body armor, can you believe that?
Vegas is bleeding us dry. We're tossing caps at a hundred different problems, while Caesar bides his time and lets us wear ourselves out.
This war is gonna bankrupt the NCR, unless we finish off the Legion fast and dirty. {Emphasis on "fast" and "dirty"}
We shouldn't be perched up at the Dam - we ought to be crossing the Colorado and sticking a boot up Caesar's ass.
So I hooked up with a couple other vets... bribed a Gun Runner...
Now we're supplying grunts, mercs, and anybody else on our side. We don't make much... but at least we're saving lives.
I'll be here a while yet, if you need any guns or ammo.
I didn't. My C.O. ordered me to flog a couple "deserters," and I told him to eat shit. So they kicked me out for insubordination.
Those kids didn't desert. They just got liquored up on the Strip and missed roll call.
I don't know what else the brass expects... half these kids don't get more than two weeks of training before they ship 'em out here.
Sure, no problem.
Well... There's been reports of trouble south, but me and Michelle can handle ourselves. And there's plenty of soldiers about, so that helps.
When 15 shut down, 95 became the route NCR citizens use to get to the Strip - or limp back home, after the Strip's drained 'em of caps.
We get 'em coming and going. Coming, the suckers flush with caps they saved to gamble on the Strip...
...and going, the same folks, but now they're losers who'll trade you the shirt off their backs so they don't starve before they make it back home.
Add in the troopers marching back and forth from McCarran and the Dam, and well, let's just say we don't miss Primm.
Michelle and I ran a little shop in Primm 'till a prison break north of town spoiled it for everyone. Goddamned convicts just about shut down I-15.
When traffic dried up, we took to our heels to find us some customers. I'm not one to sit around waiting to get saved, and Michelle ain't, neither.
Samuel Kerr at your service. Me and my daughter Michelle run this fine establishment.
We came here from Primm about a month past. Doesn't look like much, but it's one hell of a location.
Guess that makes you a big hero - in Primm. Like I said, me and Michelle didn't sit around waiting to be saved. Business is better here, anyway. {whimsical, not scolding}
You bet.
Let me see what I can do.
Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. Like our slogan says, "It's better than nothing."
Feeling thirsty?
Shit. Long as I can r-r-remember. Had a rifle in my hand since I was three, that's what my dad always says.
Learned to shoot on our ranch. Way west of here. Same as the LT, he's a f-farm kid too. 
Yeah. The {ELL-TEE} LT shouldn't have b-brought that shit up. Not with civvies, anyway. Ain't right.
Ain't right t-talking about this, anyway.
It was m-my fault. See... I was kn-knocked out when it happened. That b-big guy sneaked up on us. I let B-Betsy down.
Yeah, I'll s-s-see you around.
Yeah. You just walk away. No fool can trump the T-t-ten of Spades!
Oh. They recruited me... what, a year ago? Taught me to kick even more ass than before. These guys... they really know how to kick some ass. {Misunderstood the player's initial question - now he gets it}
N-no problem.
She's my g-g-goddamn partner. See, we work in pairs. We spot for each other. W-watch each other's backs.
Nobody wanted to w-work with me. They said I was too green. But Betsy volunteered. Shit, you don't even know how big a d-d-deal that is.
She trusts her life to the newbie, and I sit there and let her get raped by that... p-p-piece of shit. {disgusted with himself}
Shit. You sound like the LT. I should've w-woken up. I shouldn't have gotten knocked out in the f-first place. {LT = "ell-tee", disgusted with himself}
That shit was my fault. I don't want to talk about it anymore, all right?
Kickin' ass. Mostly kickin' ass. See, we're watching the perimeter right now. Looking for those F-f-fiends to come back. {trying to be cool - player just asked him what he does around here}
When they show their faces, that's when we go to work. One shot, one k-k-kill. That's the First Recon way.
The {ELL-TEE} LT t-t-told you about that? Shit. Man, that's sh-sh-shit. {surprised, upset}
Th-this again?
Nah... it's no p-problem. Everybody likes to have a little fun with me. Just shows they l-l-like me. You don't rib somebody you don't like.
The LT, Gorobets, gave it to me. See, I w-w-wanted to be Ace of Spades. But the LT says, sorry kid, you're t-t-too green. So he calls me Ten instead. 
It's okay, though. I get a few more k-k-kills under my belt, he'll move me up to Jack. Jack of Spades. Sounds better, right?
I keep at it, eventually I'll make it to Ace. Think I'll skip Queen, though.
Oh, y-yeah. My s-stuttering was w-w-way worse before.
Hey. No cause for th-that. {player is making fun of him}
Oh, yeah. F-fine. Just a little st-st-stutter. Had it since I was a kid. Doesn't stop me from k-kickin' ass. {nonchalant - player just asked if he's okay}
Yeah, r-right. That's Brahmin shit. Lucky for you we're on b-b-base, and I can't start trouble with civvies. How 'bout you get l-l-lost?
Oh, b-b-because of what that fuck Cook-Cook did? W-well, it's n-not the same thing, but D-Doc {OOS-uh-NAH-gee} Usanagi helped me with my s-s-stuttering.
The d-doc has a c-clinic north of here. Can't m-m-miss it. You should t-talk to Bitter-Root, too. He's b-been to see the doc, too.
D-d-damn right.
Hey, my man! T-t-ten of spades. First Recon sharpshooter. At your s-s-service.
Hey there, miss! T-t-ten of spades. First Recon sharpshooter. At your s-s-service.
{Betsy dead} Can't b-b-believe Betsy's gone. S-s-she was a bitch, b-but she was my p-p-partner, you know?
{Gorobets dead} S-s-sucks about the {ell-TEE} LT. N-n-nobody can replace him.
How 'bout you get out of my f-f-face? I'm First Recon. I don't need to t-take shit from civvies.
{Moving into position} K-killing some Fiendsi? Shit, yeah! It's about t-t-time!
{In position} One shot, one kill. That's how Ten of Spades p-p-plays the game.
{Nephi dead, 10 of Spades didn't get a hit} {disappointed} Shit. I didn't even get a shot at that Nephi b-b-bastard before he went down.
{Nephi dead, 10 of Spades got a hit} Right here, Fiends! This is what payback looks like! First Recon, hooah!}
{Cook-Cook dead} 'B-b-bout time Cook-Cook g-g-g-got what was c-coming to him.
You remember me, right? T-t-ten of Spades. First Recon.
I surely am. Well, sort of. I came out from Utah about six months back, saw a need for my help here.
The Followers weren't too happy about that, of course. They haven't been too fond of the NCR for a while, but I go where I'm needed.
I give what aid and comfort I can. I have medical knowledge thanks to my time with the Followers.
Well, that's an interesting question. Among the Church, I'm called Elder Gunnarsson. The Followers call me "Doc."
You can call me Bert, though.
I never was able to reach him. He has allowed drugs and hatred to consume him. He runs with the Fiends north of here, now. They call him Driver Nephi.
Poor lost souls, most of them. They thought to come to New Vegas and find their fortunes on its shining Strip.
But the journey is often long, and the price to enter the city is steep. Those who could not pay ended up here, hoping to earn the caps they need.
Some find honest labor, but more fritter away what little they've saved on crooked gambling and cheap liquor. Still, I minister to them as I can.
Following a lost cause, I'm afraid. My old friend Nephi fell in with a bad crowd.
Drug runners, raiders, probably worse things it's better not to dwell on. When his gang headed west, I followed.
I thought perhaps I could turn him back to the Church.
I've heard through the locals that Nephi has passed on. I truly hope his soul finds peace.
Welcome, brother! How can I help you?
Welcome, sister! How can I help you?
Is there something else I can do for you?
I would be happy to, should you require it. You seem to be in fine health now.
I would be happy to. What I can do isn't much, but I give it freely.
I'm afraid I have exhausted my supplies. If you come back in a day or two, I may be able to do more for you.
I only do what I can to help.
